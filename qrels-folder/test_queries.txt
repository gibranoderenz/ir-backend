2763 The long term trend from albedo is of cooling.
2765 "Earth’s Albedo has risen in the past few years, and by doing reconstructions of the past albedo, it appears that there was a significant reduction in Earth’s albedo leading up to a lull in 1997.
2766 The most interesting thing here is that the albedo forcings, in watts/sq meter seem to be fairly large.
2768 The long term trend from albedo is that of cooling.
2773 Tree-ring proxy reconstructions are reliable before 1960, tracking closely with the instrumental record and other independent proxies.
2774 Actual reconstructions "diverge" from the instrumental series in the last part of 20th century.
2775 For instance, in the original hockey stick (ending 1980) the last 30-40 years of data points slightly downwards.
2779 Europe and Asia  emit most of the soot from burning coal, wood, dung, and diesel in open  fires or without particulate filters in stoves, chimneys, smokestacks,  and exhaust pipes.
2780 The United States has been restricting soot emissions  in Draconian fashion since the Clean Air Act of 1963.
2782 "NASA satellite data from the years 2000 through 2011 show the Earth's atmosphere is allowing far more heat to be released into space than alarmist computer models have predicted, reports a new study in the peer-reviewed science journal Remote Sensing.
2783 The study indicates far less future global warming will occur than United Nations computer models have predicted, and supports prior studies indicating increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide trap far less heat than alarmists have claimed.
2784 A subsequent study by Dessler (2011) found that Spencer's paper was not a test of climate sensitivity or feedbacks, and his assumptions do not match empirical observational data.
2787 Hansen's 1988 results are evidence that the actual climate sensitivity is about 3°C for a doubling of atmospheric CO2.
2788 'On June 23, 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen testified before the House of Representatives that there was a strong "cause and effect relationship" between observed temperatures and human emissions into the atmosphere.
2789 At that time, Hansen also produced a model of the future behavior of the globe’s temperature, which he had turned into a video movie that was heavily shopped in Congress.
2790 That model predicted that global temperature between 1988 and 1997 would rise by 0.45°C (Figure 1).
2794 But his results are evidence that the actual climate sensitivity is about 3°C for a doubling of atmospheric CO2.
2796 Had he used the currently accepted value of approximately 3°C warming for a doubling of atmospheric CO2, Hansen would have correctly projected the ensuing global warming.
2797 Global brightening is caused by changes in cloud cover, reflective aerosols and absorbing aerosols.
2798 While changes in cloud cover & aerosols lead to more sunlight hitting the surface, this can be compensated by the cooling effect on the atmosphere due to fewer clouds trapping less warmth and fewer absorbing aerosols absorbing less sunlight.
2799 satellites confirmed measurements from ground stations show a considerable, and naturally-occurring, global brightening from 1983-2001 (Pinker et al., 2005).
2800 Elementary radiative-transfer calculations demonstrate that a natural surface global brightening amounting to ~1.9 Wm–2 over the 18-year period of study would be expected – using the IPCC’s own methodology – to have caused a transient warming of 1 K (1.8 F°).
2803 When we do the calculations and include all radiative forcings and the amount of heat being absorbed by the oceans, it shows that the Earth has warmed almost exactly as much as we would expect.
2805 Arctic sea ice loss is three times greater than Antarctic sea ice gain, and the amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth is increasing as a result.
2807 When the internal variability is removed from the temperature record, what we find is nearly monotonic, accelerating warming throughout the 20th Century.
2809 The motions of the massive oceans where heat is moved between deep layers and the surface provides variability on time scales from years to centuries.
2813 In fact, the authors go on to estimate climate sensitivity from their findings, calculate a value between 2.3 to 4.1°C.
2815 A new peer-reviewed study on Surface Warming and the Solar Cycle found that times of high solar activity are on average 0.2°C warmer than times of low solar activity, and that there is a polar amplification of the warming.
2817 The Petition Project features over 31,000 scientists signing the petition stating "there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide will, in the forseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere".
2818 The 30,000 scientists and science graduates listed on the OISM petition represent a tiny fraction (0.3%) of all science graduates.
2819 More importantly, the OISM list only contains 39 scientists who specialise in climate science.
2821 The fact that so many studies on climate change don't bother to endorse the consensus position is significant because scientists have largely moved from what's causing global warming onto discussing details of the problem (eg - how fast, how soon, impacts, etc).
2822 Klaus-Martin Schulte examined all papers published from 2004 to February 2007.
2826 A drop of volcanic activity in the early 20th century may have had a warming effect.
2827 However, volcanoes have had very little impact on the last 40 years of global warming.
2834 When stomata-derived CO2 (red) is compared to ice core-derived CO2 (blue), the stomata generally show much more variability in the atmospheric CO2 level and often show levels much higher than the ice cores.
2835 Arctic summer sea ice has shrunk by an area equal to Western Australia, and might be all gone in a decade.
2836 Thanks to a rapid rebound in recent months, global sea ice levels now equal those seen 29 years ago, when the year 1979 also drew to a close.
2837 In fact, the rate of increase from September onward is the fastest rate of change on record, either upwards or downwards.
2838 The data is being reported by the University of Illinois's Arctic Climate Research Center, and is derived from satellite observations of the Northern and Southern hemisphere polar regions (Daily Tech).
2839 Ice mass loss is occuring at an accelerated rate in Greenland, Antarctica and globally from inland glaciers.
2840 Arctic sea ice is also falling at an accelerated rate.
2841 The exception to this ice loss is Antarctic sea ice which has been growing despite the warming Southern Ocean.
2843 Together, these two unaltered [sea level] datasets indicate that global mean sea level trend has remained stable over the entire period 1992-2007, altogether eliminating the apparent 3.2 mm/year rate of sea-level rise arising from the “adjusted” data.
2844 The claim sea level isn’t rising is based on blatantly doctored graphs and conspiracy theories that are contradicted by empirical observational data.
2845 The original global temperature schematic which appeared in the IPCC First Assessment Report and seemed to show the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) hotter than Present was based on the central England temperature record, and ended in the 1950s.
2849 "by the 2001 [IPCC] climate assessment...the Medieval Warm Period had been ingeniously wiped out.
2853 The Ozone Layer stops UV radiation from entering our atmosphere.
2856 At present, climate forecasts even as little as six weeks ahead can be diametrically the opposite of what actually occurs, even if the forecasts are limited to a small region of the planet.'
2857 Weather is chaotic because air is light, it has low friction and viscosity, it expands strongly when in contact with hot surfaces and it conducts heat poorly.
2862 The Independent Climate Change Email Review found the CRU scientists were unhelpful and unsympathetic to information requesters and at times broke FoI laws.
2867 Skeptics who oppose scientific findings that threaten their world view are far closer to Galileo's belief-based critics in the Catholic Church.
2868 "I mean, it - I mean - and I tell somebody, I said, just because you have a group of scientists that have stood up and said here is the fact, Galileo got outvoted for a spell" (Texas Governor Rick Perry)
2869 Claims that the IPCC does not accurately represent the views and findings of the scientists, on whose work the IPCC reports are based, are not supported by the facts.
2870 Ironically, it's those who are mispresenting Hulme's paper that are the ones being misleading.
2871 'The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change misled the press and public into believing that thousands of scientists backed its claims on manmade global warming, according to Mike Hulme, a prominent climate scientist and IPCC insider.
2876 Science entitled The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change (Oreskes 2004).
2877 Benny Peiser conducted a search of peer-reviewed literature on the ISI Web of Science database between 1993 and 2003.
2880 For example, geothermal energy is available at all times, concentrated solar thermal energy has storage capability, and wind energy can be stored in compressed air.
2881 Numerous case studies on both regional and global scales have determined that renewable energy, if properly implemented, can provide baseload power.
2882 Trenberth's views are clarified in the paper "An imperative for climate change planning: tracking Earth's global energy".
2886 As it happens, the writer of that October 2009 e-mail—Kevin Trenberth, a lead author of the warmist bible, the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report—told Congress two years ago that evidence for manmade warming is "unequivocal.
2887 He claimed "the planet is running a ’fever’ and the prognosis is that it is apt to get much worse."
2888 But Trenberth’s "lack of warming at the moment" has been going on at least a decade.
2890 Heat is continuing to build up in the subsurface ocean.
2891 Wu et al (2010) use a new method to calculate ice sheet mass balance.
2894 "Rapid loss of ice-mass from the glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica are  cited as proof positive of global warming's onslaught.
2895 The latest  measurements involve the use of satellite gravimetry, estimating  the mass of terrain beneath by detecting slight changes in gravity as a  satellite passes overhead.
2896 But gravity measurements of ice-mass loss are  complicated by glacial isostatic adjustments—compensation for the rise or fall of the underlying crustal material.
2897 A new article in Nature Geoscience  describes an innovative approach employed to derive ice-mass changes  from GRACE data.
2898 The report suggests significantly smaller overall  ice-mass losses than previous estimates.
2901 Though CRU neglected to provide an exact list of temperature stations, it could not have hid or tampered with data.
2902 "So  recently the media picked up on the fact that CRU deleted the raw data for this  important global temperature set long ago.
2903 The interesting point is that it also seems each time they come across a new  dataset it is simply replaced.
2907 Maximum warming occurs over the surface during winter while less surface warming is found in summer when heat is being used to melt sea ice.
2910 The authors seem to have jumped right  into statistical  analysis without proposing a physical mechanism that  works.
2912 temperature under the ice is fixed at -2C.  Thus elevated winter   air temperatures
2914 Whatever is driving increases in winter Arctic temperatures   is not heat coming out of the Arctic Ocean, which is covered with   insulating ice.'
2915 "Pollution; none of us are supporting putting substances into the  atmosphere or the waterways that might be pollutants, but carbon dioxide  is not a pollutant.
2916 If Senator Wong was really serious about her  science she would stop breathing because you inhale air that's got 385  parts per million carbon dioxide in it
2918 Temperature errors in the Great Lakes region are not incorporated in any of the global mean temperature records.
2920 "Global warming data apparently cooked by U.S. government-funded body  shows astounding temperature fraud with increases averaging 10 to 15  degrees Fahrenheit.
2921 The tax-payer funded National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA) has become mired in fresh global warming data scandal involving  numbers for the Great Lakes region that substantially ramp up averages."
2922 Soares looks at short-term trends which are swamped by natural variations.
2924 The long-term correlation between CO2 and temperature is well established.
2927 CO2 changes are closely related to temperature.
2928 Warmer seasons or triennial phases are followed by an atmosphere that is rich in CO2, reflecting the gas solving or exsolving from water, and not photosynthesis activity.
2935 Claims have recently surfaced in the blogosphere that an increasing number of scientists are warning of an imminent global cooling, some even going so far as to call it a "growing consensus".
2939 "The climate of this planet oscillates between periods of approximately  30 years of warming followed by approximately 30 years of cooling.
2940 Rather than 100 years of unprecedented global warming as predicted by  IPCC, the global temperatures have leveled off and we seem to be heading  for cooler weather."
2942 It’s usually taken to be the fact that as carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere increase, the 1 per cent of CO2 that’s the heavier carbon isotope ratio c13 declines in proportion.
2945 But that conclusion holds true only if there are no other sources of c12 increases which are not human caused.
2948 Various independent measurements of solar activity all confirm the sun has shown a slight cooling trend since 1978.
2949 There is no single continuous satellite measurement of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI).
2951 The two most cited composites are PMOD and ACRIM.
2953 In particular, PMOD alters the data from the Nimbus7/ERB record from 1989 to 1991.
2959 Even if the warming were as big as the IPCC imagines, it would not be as dangerous as Mr. Brown suggests.
2961 Cooks ’97% consensus’ disproven by a new peer
2963 When CO2 emissions are compared directly to CO2 levels, there is a strong correlation in the long term trends.
2966 Over the three years from 1979 to 1982 when CO2 emissions were decreasing due to the rapid increase in the price of oil that drastically reduced consumption, there was no change in the rate of increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 proving that humans were not the primary source for the increase in concentration.'
2967 The contribution of waste heat to the global climate is 0.028 W/m2.
2970 "Global warming is mostly due to heat production by human industry since the 1800s, from nuclear power and fossil fuels, better termed hydrocarbons, – coal, oil, natural gas.
2973 Also, it's not yet clear whether changes in stratospheric water vapor are caused by a climate feedback or internal variability
2977 According to the study, as carbon levels have risen, the cold air at high altitudes over the tropics has actually grown colder.
2978 The lower temperatures at this "coldest point" have caused global water vapor levels to drop, even as carbon levels rise.
2979 Water vapor helps trap heat, and is a far the strongest of the major greenhouse gases, contributing 36–72 percent of the greenhouse effect.
2981 Thus rather than a "doomsday" cycle of runaway warming, Mother Earth appears surprisingly tolerant of carbon, decreasing atmospheric levels of water vapor -- a more effective greenhouse gas -- to compensate.
2982 Statistical analysis of the rate of warming over different periods find that warming from 1970 to 2001 is greater than the warming from both 1860 to 1880 and 1910 to 1940.
2983 Despite the logarithmic relationship between CO2 and surface temperatures, atmospheric CO2 levels are rising so fast that unless we dramatically decrease our emissions, global warming will accelerate over the 21st Century.
2986 As a result, the planet as a whole is becoming less reflective and absorbing more sunlight, which is accelerating global warming.
2989 While preventing global warming is relatively cheap, economists can't even accurately estimate the accelerating costs of climate damages if we continue with business-as-usual.
2991 Yet the cost of doing something will likely be higher than 6 per cent of GDP" (Bjorn Lomborg)
2992 The measurements of the amount of CO2 made at the Mauna Loa Observatory are accurate and uncontaminated by any emissions from the volcano.
2994 'Mauna Loa has been producing a readout which supports Manning's predetermined goal by showing steady growth in atmospheric CO2 concentrations since 1959.
2997 The trend in CO2 at Mauna Loa is practically identical to the global trend because CO2 mixes well throughout the atmosphere.
3000 The influence of the volcano is easily spotted and removed, together with other even more important spurious influences.
3003 Venus is not hot because of a runaway greenhouse.
3004 "The solar system oscillates with a 60-year cycle due to the Jupiter/Saturn three-synodic cycle and to a Jupiter/Saturn beat tidal cycle...
3005 About 60% of the warming observed from 1970 to 2000 was very likely caused by the above natural 60-year climatic cycle during its warming phase" (Loehle and Scafetta)
3007 There seems to be evidence for a link between solar activity and water levels.
3008 However, more direct comparisons between solar activity and global temperature finds that  as the sun grew hotter or cooler, Earth's climate followed it with a 10 year lag - presumably due to the dampening effect of the ocean.
3009 Also found was that the correlation between solar activity and global temperatures ended around 1975, hence recent warming must have some other cause than solar variations.
3011 A South African paper has found a 21 year cycle synchronous with the solar cycle (Alexander 2007).
3017 Some of the regions in which  GRACE claims ice loss in East Antarctica average colder than -30°C  during the summer, and never, ever get above freezing.
3024 Unlike the simple example of positive feedback we learned in high school, the increase from every round of feedback gets smaller and smaller, in the case of the enhanced greenhouse effect.
3032 Consequently, CO2 levels at around 1,000 to 2,300 ppm were actually low enough to promote glaciation in the southern continent of Gondwana.
3034 Since rock weathering reduces atmospheric CO2, this again reinforces the scientific fact that CO2 is a strong driver of climate.
3038 Clearly, other factors besides atmospheric carbon influence earth temperatures and global warming."
3039 Hocker is claiming that his model shows that the long-term upward trend in CO2 is explained by temperature, when his methods actually removed the long-term trend.
3044 Thousands of coral atolls have "drowned" in the past when they were unable to grow fast enough to maintain a presence at sea level
3046 There are many lines of evidence which clearly show that the atmospheric CO2 increase is caused by humans.
3047 The clearest of these is simple accounting - humans are emitting CO2 at a rate twice as fast as the atmospheric increase (natural sinks are absorbing the other half).
3048 There is no question whatsoever that the CO2 increase is human-caused.
3049 that atmospheric CO2 increase that we observe is a product of temperature  increase, and not the other way around, meaning it is a product of  natural variation...
3051 Once natural influences, in particular the impact of El Niño and La Niña, are removed from the recent termperature record, there is no evidence of a significant change in the human contribution to climate change.
3052 "...there has been no increase in the global average surface temperature for the past 16 years" (Judith Curry and David Rose)
3056 "The observed data show that CFCs conspiring with cosmic rays most likely caused both the Antarctic ozone hole and global warming...
3058 Correspondingly, the global surface temperature has also dropped."
3059 Models and direct observations find that CFCs only contribute a fraction of the warming supplied by other greenhouse gases.
3062 This increases confidence in other peer-reviewed research predicting sea level rise of 80cm to 2 metres by 2100.
3063 'Another global warming myth comes crashing down.
3064 No warming since at least 1995, no melting glaciers and now no rising sea levels.
3066 The claim that 2.2 conventional jobs are destroyed   for  every new job created in the alternative energy industry is based on a study which relies on incorrect numbers, cherrypicked dates, faulty theory, flawed methodology, and is disproven by real-world examples.
3068 for every renewable energy job that the State manages to finance, Spain’s experience...reveals with high confidence, by two different methods, that the U.S. should expect a loss of at least 2.2 jobs on average
3069 Continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century.
3070 So this is a government which is proposing to put at risk our manufacturing industry, to penalise struggling families, to make a tough situation worse for millions of households right around Australia.
3072 "a paper...in Science magazine concludes that the climate sensitivity—how much the earth’s average temperature will rise as a result of a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide—likely (that is, with a 66% probability) lies in the range 1.7°C to 2.6°C, with a median value of 2.3°C.
3074 Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), in which the likely range is given as 2.0°C to 4.5°C, with a best estimate of 3.0°C" (Pat Michaels)
3075 Multiple lines of evidence indicate Greenland's ice loss is accelerating and will contribute sea level rise in the order of metres over the next few centuries.
3079 This was the case last year too, while earlier  years in the DMI analysis period (1958-2010) hardly ever shows Arctic  melt season temperatures this cold (Frank Lansner)
3082 "However, a single scientist, Dr. Ben Santer of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, rewrote the draft at the IPCC’s request, deleting all five statements, replacing them with a single statement to the effect that a human influence on global climate was now discernible, and making some 200 consequential amendments.
3084 "the temperature increase in the second half of the 20th century could have taken place in steps driven by major ENSO events" (Jens Raunsø Jensen)
3090 A generous estimate of the energy generated by satellites is around 1 million times too small to cause global warming.
3091 Global Warming history completely coincides with the history of artificial satellites and the use of microwave frequencies from outer space.
3093 Sending oscillating microwaves from an antenna inside a vacuum through an electromagnetic field through a dielectric material, such as water, creates radio frequency heating at the molecular level
3099 "The IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report, 2007, carries in three places a graph in which the Hadley Center’s global mean surface temperature anomaly dataset from 1850-2005 is displayed with four arbitrarily-chosen trend-lines overlaid upon it.
3102 ...there [is] anecdotal and other evidence suggesting similar melts from 1938-43 and on other occasions.

3104 the satellite sensors show less warming in the lower troposphere (approximately 10,000 feet above the earth’s surface) than is reported by surface temperature readings.
3105 Global warming theory holds that one of the fingerprints of human-induced global warming is more rapid warming in the lower troposphere than at the surface (James Taylor)
3110 In those days you couldn’t have seen across the street for all the carbon emissions and the crap coming out of the chimneys.'
3111 Ljungqvist's millennial temperature reconstruction was very similar to Moberg et al.
3112 It also concludes that current northern hemisphere surface air temperatures are significantly higher than during the peak of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP).
3114 'What I can comment on is this prediction by Dr. Hansen: “The West Side Highway [which runs along the Hudson River] will be under water.”
3119 CO2 constitutes 80% of the non-condensing greenhouse gas forcing.
3121 "Cloud cover in models is poorly treated and inaccurately predicted.
3122 Yet clouds reflect about seventy-five watts per square meter.
3123 Given that a doubling of carbon dioxide would change the surface heat flux by only two watts per square meter, it is evident that a small change in cloud cover can strongly affect the response to carbon dioxide."
3124 the Great Barrier Reef is in fine fettle
3125 About 60% of the warming observed from 1970 to 2000 was very likely caused by this natural 60-year climatic cycle during its warming phase...
3127 "Skeptics hope that Postma’s alternative thermal model will lead  to the birth of a new climatology, one that actually follows the laws of  physics and properly physical modeling techniques...
3130 "There are other possible causes for climate change which could be associated with solar activity or related to variations in the temperature of the liquid core of the Earth, which is about 5,400 degrees Celsius.
3131 We don't need a high heat flow - just a high temperature for the core to affect the surface climate.
3134 Over the last decade, heatwaves are five times more likely than if there had been no global warming.
