0 Global warming is driving polar bears toward extinction
5 The sun has gone into ‘lockdown’ which could cause freezing weather, earthquakes and famine, say scientists
6 The polar bear population has been growing.
9 Ironic' study finds more CO2 has slightly cooled the planet
10 Human additions of CO2 are in the margin of error of current measurements and the gradual increase in CO2 is mainly from oceans degassing as the planet slowly emerges from the last ice age.
11 They tell us that we are the primary forces controlling earth temperatures by the burning of fossil fuels and releasing their carbon dioxide.
14 The Great Barrier Reef is experiencing the most widespread bleaching ever recorded
18 it’s not a pollutant that threatens human civilization.
19 If CO2 was so terrible for the planet, then installing a CO2 generator in a greenhouse would kill the plants.
21 Sea level rise has been slow and a constant, pre-dating industrialization
27 Earth about to enter 30-YEAR ‘Mini Ice Age’
28 Volcanoes Melting West Antarctic Glaciers, Not Global Warming
30 the bushfires [in Australia] were caused by arsonists and a series of lightning strikes, not 'climate change'
31 Discovery Of Massive Volcanic CO2 Emissions Discredits Global Warming Theory
33 Harvard study finds that wind turbines create MORE global warming than the fossil fuels they eliminate
35 Ice berg melts, ocean level remains the same.
36 When the exact same group of 'experts' who claimed it was global cooling in 1977 now claim it's global warming you can easily see why I am skeptical
38 Scientists studying Antarctica sea ice warn a rise in accumulation could spark the next ice age.
41 More than 500 scientists and professionals in climate and related fields have sent a 'European Climate Declaration' to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
42 Unprecedented climate change has caused sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years.
44 Human-produced carbon might be one of the factors [of climate change], but there’s simply no evidence that it is a significant one.
51 CO2 does not cause climate change, it RESPONDS to it [...]
55 [T]he raw data, the actual thermometer data[...] shows that the US has been cooling for 80 to 90 years.
57 Earth’s mean temperature over the last 2,000 years shows two previous periods when temperatures were warmer than they are now; from 1–200 A.D., an epoch called the Roman Warm Period, and more recently the Medieval Warm Period from 900–1100 A.D.
60 So that means that probably about half, maybe half of that nine-tenths of the degree [of total warming] might be caused by greenhouse gases
61 [NASA] has been adjusting temperatures from the past[...]
65 A windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it.
67 Fifty-five thousand years ago the whole world was 2°C warmer than it is today[...]
69 Sea level rise is not going to happen.
71 Cold weather to grip world as solar minimum to deepen, NASA says
72 [O]ne of the previously fastest shrinking glaciers in the world is growing again, calling into question the narrative that rapid climate change [...]
74 The models predicted about three times the amount of warming in the world we’ve seen since [1988].
75 The science is clear, climate change is making extreme weather events, including tornadoes, worse.
76 Burping cows are more damaging to the climate than all the cars on this planet.
77 [S]unspot activity on the surface of our star has dropped to a new low.
79 The rate of warming according to the data is much slower than the models used by the IPCC
82 The ­atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is five years
85 Sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2
86 There isn’t yet any empirical evidence for their claim that greenhouse gases even cause temperatures to increase.
87 NOAA has adjusted past temperatures to look colder than they were and recent temperatures to look warmer than they were.
91 They were going to be gone by now, but now they're setting records
93 unadjusted data suggests that temperatures in Australia have only increased by 0.3 degrees over the past century, not the 1 degree usually claimed
95 [climate scientists] say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse.
96 The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is sort of the voice of the consensus, concedes that there has been no increase in extreme weather events.
97 according, again, to the official figures—during this past 10 years, if anything, mean global temperature, average world temperature, has slightly declined
98 Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid.
99 Most likely the primary control knob [on climate change] is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.
100 'Global warming' is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.
101 Neither the rate nor the magnitude of the reported late twentieth century surface warming (1979–2000) lay outside normal natural variability.
102 Forward projections of solar cyclicity imply the next few decades may be marked by global cooling rather than warming, despite continuing CO2 emissions.
103 global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed (since 1997) by 19 years of stable temperature
104 Increases in atmospheric CO2 followed increases in temperature.
105 Therefore, CO2 levels could not have forced temperatures to rise.
108 sea-level rise is not accelerating.
109 Local and regional sea levels continue to exhibit typical natural variability—in some places rising and in others falling.
113 The temperature is not rising nearly as fast as the alarmist computer models predicted.
118 more than 100 per cent of the warming over the past century is due to human actions
120 90 per cent of the world's coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years due to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution and over-development.
123 the warming is not nearly as great as the climate change computer models have predicted.
126 El Niño drove record highs in global temperatures suggesting rise may not be down to man-made emissions.
127 Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty.
128 Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated.
129 Sea level rise could reach six or seven feet by the year 2100.
132 Climate change is not making natural disasters worse
133 The amount of land we use for meat — humankind’s biggest use of land — has declined by an area nearly as large as Alaska
135 Carbon emissions are declining in most rich nations and have been declining in Britain, Germany, and France since the mid-1970s
137 Preventing future pandemics requires more not less “industrial” agriculture
138 As a result, half of the people surveyed around the world last year said they thought climate change would make humanity extinct.
139 And in January, one out of five British children told pollsters they were having nightmares about climate change.
141 Greenpeace didn’t save the whales, switching from whale oil to petroleum and palm oil did
142 Worst-case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards in light of a better understanding of the role of clouds, scientists have said.
143 Recent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed
148 Previous IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out.
152 “Catherine Senior, head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols.
157 Contemporary Global Warming placed in geological context.
161 Extreme melting and changes to the climate like this has released pressure on to the continent, allowing the ground to rise up.
163 We’ve contacted them to ask more details about the size of the Sif.
164 Small increases in average temperature translate to big increases in the number of extremely hot days, and those hot days have a big impact.
165 When the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action approached the Federal Government in April they were drawing on decades of data showing that fire conditions are getting worse.
168 As the temperature has increased, so has the ability of scientists to determine whether specific events are linked to climate change.
169 They can now model how likely a specific event would be to occur under historical conditions, compared to the record temperatures we’re experiencing.
171 We’ll still be facing extreme heat, but at a far more manageable level than if we’d done nothing to halt climate change.
173 If there were [carbon emissions], we could not see because most carbon is black.
180 Reef material is calcium carbonate, which contains 44 per cent carbon dioxide.
181 Reefs need carbon dioxide; it’s their basic food.
184 It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.
185 Modellers assume carbon dioxide drives climate change
189 The geological history of the planet shows major planetary climate changes have never been driven by a trace gas
190 Climate change is normal and continual.
194 The main greenhouse gas is water vapour[…]
195 Carbon dioxide is a non-condensable atmospheric gas like nitrogen and oxygen
196 Without carbon dioxide, all life on Earth would die
197 Plants need almost three times today’s carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere to thrive.
198 For decades horticulturalists have pumped carbon dioxide into glasshouses to increase yields.
199 In the past, warming has never been a threat to life on Earth.
200 if we halved today’s atmospheric carbon dioxide content, all life would die.
203 In our lifetime, there has been no correlation between carbon dioxide emissions and temperature
204 after a natural orbitally driven warming, atmospheric carbon dioxide content increases 800 years later
207 Each of the six major past ice ages began when the atmospheric carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present.
211 For decades, most scientists saw climate change as a distant prospect.
214 A recent essay in Scientific American argued that scientists “tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold” and said one of the reasons was “the perceived need for consensus.”
216 [The 1990 IPCC report said] that the Antarctic ice sheets were stable
220 Hurricane Harvey gave Houston and the surrounding region a $125 billion lesson about the costs of misjudging the potential for floods
230 In the early 2000s, ice shelves began disintegrating in several parts of Antarctica, and scientists realized that process could greatly accelerate the demise of the vastly larger ice sheets themselves.
235 The planet’s average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F (0.9C)
236 global temperatures have risen between 0.23F (0.13C) and 0.34F (0.19C) per decade
237 However the warming trend is slower than most climate models have forecast
240 In 1990 the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that temperatures would rise by 0.54F (0.3C) per decade.
243 In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010.
244 But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.
246 at the end of recent ice ages, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise only after temperatures began to climb.
248 But by far the largest greenhouse gas is water vapour, which makes 95 per cent of the total.
250 CO2 is not powerful in that sense, the only thing it does in the system is make the planet greener.
254 it’s virtually impossible to get funded for work that disputes climate change through other channels [other than oil companies]
256 One of the main areas of contention is the existence of two strange climate episodes known as The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age.
257 The MWP lasted from about 950 to 1250AD, and temperature records appear to show it was even hotter than today
258 But the period has caused a headache for climate scientists because clearly there was no upswell in carbon dioxide that could account for such swift warming.
261 in 1995 one scientist at the IPCC – Jonathan Overpeck – wrote an email to a colleague claiming ‘we have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.’
263 it later emerged that its creator Dr Michael Mann had spliced too [sic] datasets together – tree-rings showing temperatures going back hundreds of years, then recent thermometer readings for the more recent decades.
266 The IPCC no longer includes the ‘Hockey stick’ chart in its reports.
267 Yet a study published just this week, by the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway, found that the natural climate system can change abruptly, without the need for any external forces.
268 Some scientists believe that solar activity is more likely to influence today’s climate than carbon dioxide, and Dr Soon has compiled data showing temperature in America, Canada and Mexico rises and falls in line with solar activity.
272 The melting ice has led to global sea level rise of around eight inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880.
275 until temperature increases began to slow down after 1998 and remained relatively stable for a period of 15 years
279 In one particularly damning email, CRU director Phil Jones said he had used ‘Mike’s Nature trick’ to ‘hide the decline’ in temperatures in the second half of the 20th century.
281 In an interview with the BBC after the scandal broke, Dr Jones admitted there had been no statistically significant global warming since 1995
282 The panel was forced to retract a statement in its 2007 report saying all Himalayan glaciers could melt entirely by 2035.
284 The figure traditionally cited that suggests 97 per cent of climate scientists agree that global warming is man-made was also found to be flawed.
287 Climate skeptics argue temperature records have been adjusted in recent years to make the past appear cooler and the present warmer, although the Carbon Brief showed that NOAA has actually made the past warmer, evening out the difference.
293 When the measuring equipment gets old and needs replacing, it often requires re-calibration.
294 A global network of 500 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message.
296 The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850.
298 Only very few peer-reviewed papers even go so far as to say that recent warming is chiefly anthropogenic.
302 In addition, [climate models] ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial
305 There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying[…] floods
306 There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying[…] droughts
307 For instance, wind turbines kill birds and insects, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests
310 [data] show only slight warming, mostly at night and in winter
311 there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events,
313 Let’s find out by comparing the actual temperatures since 1979 with what the 32 families of climate models used in the latest U.N. report on climate science predicted they would be.
316 the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed
319 Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean, and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere.
320 Globally averaged thermometers show two periods of warming since 1900: a half-degree from natural causes in the first half of the 20th century, before there was an increase in industrial carbon dioxide that was enough to produce it, and another half-degree in the last quarter of the century.
322 The first adjustment changed how the temperature of the ocean surface is calculated, by replacing satellite data with drifting buoys and temperatures in ships’ water intake.
331 But each serial adjustment has tended to make the early years colder, which increases the warming trend.
332 Shelters in poorer countries are not repainted as often, and darker stations absorb more of the sun’s energy.
335 Last month was the hottest June ever recorded, European satellite agency announces
337 temperatures were 6-10C above normal over most of France, Germany and northern Spain during the final days of the month, according to C3S.
338 Rapid assessment of average temperatures in France between 26-28 June showed a “substantial” increase in the likelihood of the heatwave happening as a result of human-caused global warming, experts at the World Weather Attribution group said.
340 Heatwaves occur in any climate, but we know that heatwaves are becoming much more likely due to climate change.
342 While members of the media may nod along to such claims [about changes in weather extremes], the evidence paints a different story
343 They concluded that trends toward rising climate damages were mainly due to increased population and economic activity in the path of storms, that it was not currently possible to determine the portion of damages attributable to greenhouse gases, and that they didn’t expect that situation to change in the near future.
344 Globally there’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods.
348 There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S.
349 Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally.
350 Since 1965, more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase.
351 And from 1940 to today, flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent.
353 The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather
356 This requires us to work towards avoiding catastrophic possibilities rather than looking at probabilities, as learning from mistakes is not an option when it comes to existential risks.
357 With that in mind, they propose a plausible and terrifying “2050 scenario” whereby humanity could face irreversible collapse in just three decades.
358 Their analysis calculates the existential climate-related security risk to Earth through a scenario set 30 years into the future.
362 North America suffers extreme weather events including wildfires, drought, and heatwaves.
363 Monsoons in China fail, the great rivers of Asia virtually dry up, and rainfall in central America falls by half.
365 The knock-on consequences affect national security, as the scale of the challenges involved, such as pandemic disease outbreaks, are overwhelming.
366 Armed conflicts over resources may become a reality, and have the potential to escalate into nuclear war.
368 The most recent IPCC report lays out a future if we limit global heating to 1.5°C instead of the Paris Agreement’s 2°C.
369 By 2050 there’s a scientific consensus that we reached the tipping point for ice sheets in Greenland and the West Antarctic
373 Like countless other organ­isms, we move and adapt when the environment changes.
375 when 3 per cent of total annual global emissions of carbon dioxide are from humans and Australia prod­uces 1.3 per cent of this 3 per cent, then no amount of emissions reductio­n here will have any effect on global climate.
376 whenever in the past there was an explosion of plant life, the carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present.
377 If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, all life dies.
378 for thousands of millions of years the Earth has been changing, with cycles­ and one-off events such as an asteroid impact, super-volcano or a supernova explosion.
381 [subsidies for wind and solar] add to emissions because coal-fired elec­tricity needs to be on standby for when there is no wind or sunshine.
382 The amount of energy used to construct solar and wind facilities is greater than they produce in their working lives.
383 “As soon as renewables were introduced into the grid, electric­ity prices increased and delivery became unreliable.
386 Renew­ables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.
388 We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit.
390 there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.
392 a study that totally debunks the whole concept of man-made Global Warming
398 nothing we can do to stop the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles.
399 Climate Change ‘Heat Records’ Are a Huge Data Manipulation
400 The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate.
401 On Feb. 7, several major newspapers carried stories of the declaration by NASA and NOAA that the past five years have been the warmest on record.
404 Actual weather records over the past 100 years show no correlation between rising carbon dioxide levels and local temperatures.
409 as time progresses and fossil fuel emissions increase, the number of record highs should increase and record lows should decrease.
412 From 1970 until 1998 there was a warming period that raised temperatures by about 0.7 F that helped spawn the global warming alarmist movement.
413 However, since 1998, little warming has occurred while carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase.
418 describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040
419 But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.
420 International Energy Agency, a global analysis organization, “continue to see a role for coal for the foreseeable future.”
424 Duffy pointed out that his chart was from a single tide gauge station, near San Francisco, and that sea levels rise at different rates around the world
428 Brooks added that Antarctic ice is growing.
430 “But there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing.
432 Climate scientists use the 20th-century average as a benchmark for global temperature measurements.
434 It’s also a sufficiently long period to include several cycles of climate variability.
435 NOAA’s analysis found last month was the 3rd-warmest April on record globally.
436 The unusual heat was most noteworthy in Europe, which had its warmest April on record, and Australia, which had its second-warmest.
441 For the year-to-date, the Earth is seeing its 5th-warmest start to the year.
442 There is no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of Global Warming
443 “Today climate scientists are obsessed with the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a very very small part of the overall picture.
444 Carbon dioxide is a trace gas.”
446 It’s not carbon dioxide, it’s not methane… Scientists estimate that somewhere between 75% and 90% of Earth greenhouse effect is caused by water vapor in clouds.”
447 “Every day, nature puts twenty times as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as all of Earth industries.
449 So it’s clear now we’re not seeing dangerous global warming, and the climate models are wrong.
450 If we double atmospheric carbon dioxide[…] we’d only raise global surface temperatures by about a degree Celsius.
451 The idea that the much smaller carbon dioxide cycle is now controlling the water cycle is not very likely.
452 “So the bottom line of all this is that climate change is natural, not man-made.
454 Man-made greenhouse gases play only an insignificant role.”
455 Climate scientists are telling us it’s likely we’re going to be in for a period of cooling.
457 temperatures rise and they fall, and they rise and they fall… and for the last 400 years we’ve had a gentle warming as we’ve been coming out of the little ice age.
461 Temperatures cooled from about 1940 to 1975, and then they rose from about ’75 to about 2005 or so, and since then they’ve been flat or cooling.
463 “So now we’re able to explain from natural factors how we’ve had the 20th Century warming.
467 This is the South Pole ice, 90% of Earth’s ice, and it’s getting thicker.
469 Ocean levels have been rising for the last 20,000 years[…] No climate scientist can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man-made sea level rise began.
470 According to NASA, the globally averaged temperature of the land and ocean was 0.9˚C (1.62˚F) above the 20th century average.
473 La Niñas, on the other hand, feature cooler than average waters in the Pacific
474 Sea ice continued its declining trend, both in the Arctic and Antarctic.
477 Scientists say halting deforestation ‘just as urgent’ as reducing emissions
478 Protecting and restoring forests would reduce 18% of emissions by 2030
482 It is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system, rather than forests.
484 “We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.
487 “It’s horrifying that we’d lose our biodiversity to avert climate change.
488 Losing tropical forests is not somehow cheaper than putting up wind farms in the US or Sahara.”
490 IPCC report warning last week the world is “nowhere near on track” to meet its Paris commitments
492 But like most claims regarding global warming, the real effect is small, probably temporary, and most likely due to natural weather patterns
493 Coastal lake sediments along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from 1,000 to 2,000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today.
494 The Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635 experienced a Category 3 or 4 storm, with up to a 20-foot storm surge.
495 While such a storm does not happen in New England anymore, it happened again there in 1675, with elderly eyewitnesses comparing it to the 1635 storm.
496 Nine years into that 11-year hurricane drought, a NASA scientist computed it as a 1-in-177-year event.
498 The 30 most costly hurricanes in U.S. history (according to federal data from January) show no increase in intensity over time.
499 The monetary cost of damages has increased dramatically in recent decades, but that is due to increasing population, wealth and the amount of vulnerable infrastructure.
502 But abnormal temperature spikes in February and earlier this month have left it vulnerable to winds, which have pushed the ice further away from the coast than at any time since satellite records began in the 1970s.”
503 “During the sunless winter, a heatwave raised concerns that the polar vortex may be eroding.
506 More than 100 climate models over the past 30 years did not predict what actually happened because it was assumed carbon dioxide had the pivotal role in driving climate change and that the effects of clouds, back-radiation and the sun were trivial.
508 Climate projections also assume that planet Earth is not dynamic
512 water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide has had a minuscule effect on global climate
516 For the past 4567 million years, the sun and the Earth’s orbit have driven climate change cycles.
519 Since then, the planet has been cooling on a millennial scale
520 Just 1.25 per cent of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere-ocean system has been released by ­humans in the past 250 years.
527 Our evolving dynamic planet has survived sea level changes of hundreds of metres
528 Our evolving dynamic planet has survived[…] mass extinctions
530 South Australia is winning: it has the most unreliable grid in the world outside Africa and the most expensive electricity.
531 When South Australians buy electricity at $14,200/MWh, they are paying the equivalent of $400 a litre for petrol.
532 Never mind that the emissions of carbon dioxide to make and maintain a wind or solar industrial complex are far greater than they will ever save.
534 Domino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state
538 Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25°C, forest dieback will add 0.11°C, permafrost thaw will add 0.9°C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02°C.
539 We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions,” she said.
540 The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming
548 The jet stream controls broad weather patterns, such as high-pressure and low-pressure systems.
549 The extent of climate change’s influence on the jet stream is an intense subject of research.
550 Last year, scientists published evidence that the conditions leading up to “stuck jet streams” are becoming more common, with warming in the Arctic seen as a likely culprit.
551 Gone are the days when scientists drew a bright line dividing weather and climate.
554 The heaviest precipitation events will become more frequent and more extreme.
555 In Alaska, brown bears are changing their feeding habits to eat elderberries that ripen earlier.
556 The April low temperatures here are now about 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they used to be.
558 Species that have a lot of plasticity tend to be generalists.
559 And there is a lot of evidence that climate change is diminishing biodiversity, which can be seen in these alpine meadows as well.
562 current climate predictions may underestimate long-term warming by as much as a factor of two
564 This could mean the landmark Paris Climate Agreement – which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels – may not be enough to ward off catastrophe.
565 In looking at Earth’s past, scientists can predict what the future will look like
567 But as the change gets larger or more persistent … it appears they underestimate climate change
568 The research also revealed how large areas of the polar ice caps could collapse and significant changes to ecosystems could see the Sahara Desert become green and the edges of tropical forests turn into fire-dominated savanna.
575 While an isolated heatwave can be put down as an anomaly, the scale of this phenomenon points to global warming as the culprit, scientists said.
576 ‘Summers keep getting hotter,’ said Friederike Otto of the University of Oxford, who conducted extensive research into data from the heatwave that spread Europe in June, July and August 2017.
577 ‘Heatwaves are far more intense than when my parents were growing up in the 1950s.
578 ‘If we do nothing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm when my young son is a grown man.’
581 the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm
582 On the other side of the Atlantic ocean, climates are typically milder as a result of the cooling from the Gulf Stream.
583 But despite [the Gulf Stream], the summer of 2018 looks set to be one of the hottest on record.
586 The sun was so intense, it took the mercury up to in excess of 120°F as it topped out at 122.4 °F (50.2°C).
590 Their ECS estimate is 1.5 degrees, with a probability range between 1.05 and 2.45 degrees.
591 But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams (as this interactive graphic shows), using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges, all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases.
593 It shows that ECS is probably between two and 4.5 degrees, possibly as low as 1.5 but not lower, and possibly as high as nine degrees.
598 If ECS is as low as the Energy Balance literature suggests, it means that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and need to be revised.
603 Whether Antarctic mass loss keeps worsening depends on choices made today
609 That’s because as Antarctica’s mass shrinks, the ice sheet’s gravitational pull on the ocean relaxes somewhat, and the seas travel back across the globe to pile up far away — with U.S. coasts being one prime destination.”
614 The Rio Grande is a classic “feast or famine” river, with a dry year or two typically followed by a couple of wet years that allow for recovery.
615 If warming temperatures brought on by greenhouse gas emissions make wet years less wet and dry years even drier, as scientists anticipate, year-to-year recovery will become more difficult.
616 The effect of long-term warming is to make it harder to count on snowmelt runoff in wet times
619 Last year, though, was a wet one on the Rio Grande, with a strong snowpack in the winter of 2016-17 that allowed the conservancy district to store water in upstream reservoirs.
620 Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) from 1901 to 2010, and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century.
621 Dr. Gutzler said spring temperatures have an impact, too, with warmer air causing more snow to turn to vapor and essentially disappear.
622 A longer and warmer growing season also has an effect, Dr. Overpeck said, as plants take up more water, further reducing stream flows.
623 The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea-level rise as an “enigma”
625 I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming; it continues at the same rate, 1.8 millimeters a year, according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr.
626 The trend has been measured by a network of tidal gauges, many of which have been collecting data for over a century.
628 as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted
630 I conclude that it must be ice accumulation, through evaporation of ocean water, and subsequent precipitation turning into ice.
633 Currently, sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2.
634 But there is also good data showing sea levels
637 By 2100 the seas will rise another 6 inches or so—a far cry from Al Gore’s alarming numbers
638 Mr. Singer is a professor emeritus of environmental science at the University of Virginia.
642 Some experts think we’re on track to hit 550 ppm by the end of the century, which would cause average global temperatures to rise by 6 degrees Celsius
644 an individual heatwave triggering coral bleaching cannot be linked to global warming as the process triggering an individual heatwave is fundamentally different from that triggering global warming
645 Scientists just discovered a massive, heretofore unknown, source of nitrogen
646 If Houlton’s finding about these vast, previously unknown nitrogen stores holds true, then it would have an enormous impact on global warming predictions.
648 ‘there will not be enough nitrogen available to sustain the high carbon uptake scenarios.’
649 “Houlton has been exploring this possibility for years.
656 The Arctic’s carbon bomb might be even more potent than we thought […] methane, a shorter-lived but far harder-hitting gas that could cause faster bursts of warming
661 “Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050, the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn’t happen.
662 Rather, global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved.”
663 “For example, Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart, depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet.
665 many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals (the primary prey of polar bears) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season, which is particularly conducive to fishing
666 while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.
667 The failure of the 2007 polar bear survival model is a simple fact that explodes the myth that polar bears are on their way to extinction.
668 Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.
669 Sea level rise of 65 centimeters, or roughly 2 feet would cause significant problems for coastal cities around the world.
676 more so than downsizing one’s car, or being vigilant about turning off light bulbs, and certainly more than quitting showering.
677 “Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows, and the cows will convert the beans to meat, and the humans will eat the meat.
678 In the process, the cows will emit much greenhouse gas, and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat, meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people.”
687 When the heat buildup in the ocean is taken into account, global temperatures are rising relentlessly.
688 “The arc of global warming will be variously steep and less steep,’ said Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.
689 The heat extremes were especially pervasive in the Arctic, with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the Arctic Ocean.
692 “We indicated 23 years ago — in our 1994 Nature article — that climate models had the atmosphere’s sensitivity to CO2 much too high,” Christy said in a statement.
695 Models are too sensitive to increases in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, he said.
696 climate models predict too much warming in the troposphere
697 While many scientists have acknowledged the mismatch between model predictions and actual temperature observations, few have really challenged the validity of the models themselves.
698 A recent study led by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory climate scientist Ben Santer found that while the models ran hot, the ‘overestimation’ was ‘partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations.’
699 While volcanic eruptions are natural events, it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend
701 “‘Those eruptions happened relatively early in our study period, which pushed down temperatures in the first part of the dataset, which caused the overall record to show an exaggerated warming trend,’ Christy said.
702 ‘While volcanic eruptions are natural events, it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend.
703 If the same eruptions had happened near the more recent end of the dataset, they could have pushed the overall trend into negative numbers, or a long-term cooling,’ Christy said.”
705 policies based on previous climate model output and predictions might need to be reconsidered
708 Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continent’s ice was in relative balance
710 With marine ice cliff instability, sea-level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago
712 “Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings.
716 Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode.
717 Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates
721 “‘If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,’ says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge.
724 A fast transition away from fossil fuels in the next few decades could be enough to put off rapid sea-level rise for centuries.
728 The sea was much colder than previously thought, the study suggests, indicating that climate change is advancing at an unprecedented rate”
736 But the new research shows that the amount of oxygen in those shells doesn’t actually remain constant over time.
737 The new research showed that [oxygen isotopes in foraminifera] can change
739 The changes in the amount of oxygen in the shells isn’t a reflection of changing temperatures – just a consequence of the fact that the amount of oxygen seen changes over time anyway.
740 “To revisit the ocean’s paleotemperatures now, we need to carefully quantify this re-equilibration, which has been overlooked for too long.
741 For that, we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time”
742 Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions.
745 The past shows that climate change is normal, that warmer times and more atmospheric carbon dioxide have driven biodiversity and that cold times kill.”
749 “The worldwide temperature record has been changed.
752 [South Australia] has the most expensive electricity in the world.
755 [Those who signed the Paris Accord] cannot change Earth’s orbit and radiation released from the sun that drive climate
756 Australia’s signed a suicide note [with the Paris Accord] yet didn’t seem to notice that China, India, Indonesia and the US did not commit to reducing their large carbon dioxide emissions.
757 The grasslands, crops, forests and territorial waters of Australia absorb more carbon dioxide than Australia emits.
761 [Riebesell] is a world authority on the topic and has typically communicated cautiously about the effects of acidification.
762 ‘But even if an organism isn’t directly harmed by acidification it may be affected indirectly through changes in its habitat or changes in the food web.’
763 And some plants – like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis – may even benefit.
764 […]You can think of global warming as one type of climate change.
765 The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.”
768 “We’ve known about [the greenhouse effect] for more than a century.
770 [CO2] has increased 43 percent above the pre-industrial level so far
772 Geologists say that humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done.
774 The warming is extremely rapid on the geologic time scale, and no other factor can explain it as well as human emissions of greenhouse gases.
775 Instead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market-oriented, some political conservatives have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science.
776 Over the coming 25 or 30 years, scientists say, the climate is likely to gradually warm
784 “Scientists have published strong evidence that the warming climate is making heat waves more frequent and intense.
785 In many other cases, though — hurricanes, for example — the linkage to global warming for particular trends is uncertain or disputed.
787 The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero.
788 But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.
789 Converting to these cleaner sources [of energy] may be somewhat costlier in the short term, but they could ultimately pay for themselves by heading off climate damages and reducing health problems associated with dirty air.
791 ‘Clean coal’ is an approach in which the emissions from coal-burning power plants would be captured and pumped underground.
797 Climate Models Have Overestimated Global Warming
799 the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming ‘hiatus’
800 The report, published in the journal Nature Geoscience on September 18, acknowledges that most of the models of warming trends failed to predict the ‘slowdown’ in warming post-2000, resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 ‘emissions budget’ for the coming decades.
802 that likewise determined that the actual increases in warming post-2000 was ‘generally smaller than trends estimated’ from the models.”
803 The team of climate scientists notes that in failing to predict the warming ‘hiatus’ in the beginning of the 21st century, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models overestimated temperature increases…
805 The answer lies in the summer’s record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts.
806 Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August.”
807 the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming.
809 In the early 20th century, state and federal governments began aggressively fighting wildfires and trying to keep them as small as possible.
811 But [climate scientists] say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse.
812 The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm
814 Global Ocean Circulation Appears To Be Collapsing Due To A Warming Planet
815 Evidence is growing that the comparatively cold zone within the Northern Atlantic could be due to a slowdown of this global ocean water circulation.
816 While geologists have studied events in the past similar to what appears to be happening today, scientists are largely unsure of what lies ahead.
817 Scientists have long known about the anomalous ‘warming hole‘ in the North Atlantic Ocean, an area immune to warming of Earth’s oceans.
818 “Carbon dioxide hurts nobody’s health.
819 Climate change need not endanger anyone”
820 “Healthy societies do not fall apart over slow, widely predicted, relatively small economic adjustments of the sort painted by climate analysis.
821 Societies do fall apart from war, disease or chaos.
822 Climate policy must compete with other long-term threats for always-scarce resources.”
823 ’Extremely remarkable’ 2017 heads toward record for hottest year without an El Niño episode.
824 So it’s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm — because the last El Niño ended a year ago.
826 The latest NOAA report is “a reminder that climate change has not, despite the insistence of climate contrarians ‘paused’ or even slowed down,” Mann said..
828 Famine, economic collapse, a sun that cooks us: What climate change could wreak — sooner than you think.
830 parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable
832 Or the news from Antarctica this past May, when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept going; the break now has just three miles to go — by the time you read this, it may already have met the open water, where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever, a process known poetically as ‘calving.’
839 “Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable, annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015.
840 At four degrees, the deadly European heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a day, will be a normal summer.
846 In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.
847 “The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere).
849 The most notorious was 252 million years ago; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees, accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic, and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead.”
851 The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World, his new history of the planet’s major extinction events, the oceans were hundreds of feet higher.
855 Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them.”
856 as the pathbreaking work by Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown, the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature — which means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity.
859 By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl ever was.
861 None of these places, which today supply much of the world’s food, will be reliable sources of any.
862 In the sugarcane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease, including over a quarter of the men, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago.
863 The warmer the planet gets, the more ozone forms, and by mid-century, Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent increase in unhealthy ozone smog, the National Center for Atmospheric Research has projected.
864 “[Carbon dioxide] just crossed 400 parts per million, and high-end estimates extrapolating from current trends suggest it will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100.
868 In Alaska, already, researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918 flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100 million”
871 “As it happens, Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation.
880 The peer-reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets[…]
888 the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century
889 “Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity.
892 Despite recent attempts to paint the United States as a major global polluter, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. is among the cleanest nations on the planet.
893 While France and other G7 countries lamented the U.S. exit from the Paris climate accord, America’s air is already cleaner than that of any other country in the G7, except Canada with its scant population.
896 According to the WHO, exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.
897 The report […] found that the United States was one of the most pollution-free nations in the world.”
901 CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic.
903 Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.”
904 Without human intervention, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) in prior eras, whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm.
905 “Some experts, such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany, have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity.
906 Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere ‘is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally.”
909 Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs.
910 The cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21% 19%, and 11% respectively.”
914 The Clean Power Plan, a major component of fulfilling the agreement, would spike energy costs for working and middle-class Texans by 16% by 2030, according to the Economic Reliability Council of Texas
916 The acceleration is making some scientists fear that Antarctica’s ice sheet may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration.
917 Because the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically, the continued existence of the world’s great coastal cities — Miami, New York, Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica’s fate.
919 an airplane is contributing to the emissions that put the frozen continent at risk.
920 If those emissions continue unchecked and the world is allowed to heat up enough, scientists have no doubt that large parts of Antarctica will melt into the sea.
925 About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades.
926 The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.”
930 “Right now, the shelf works like a giant bottle-stopper that slows down ice trying to flow from the land into the sea.
932 The most vulnerable parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet could raise the sea level by 10 to 15 feet, inundating many of the world’s coastal cities, though most scientists think that would take well over a century, or perhaps longer.
935 The winds around the continent seem to be strengthening, stirring the ocean and bringing up a layer of warmer water that has most likely been there for centuries.
938 We’re not sure because we don’t have enough data, for long enough, to separate signal from noise,” said Eric J. Steig, a scientist at the University of Washington who has studied temperature trends in Antarctica.
939 “Recent computer forecasts suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high level, parts of Antarctica could break up rapidly, causing the ocean to rise six feet or more by the end of this century.
942 ‘We could be decades too fast, or decades too slow,’said one of them, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
945 In their worst-case scenario, the sea level could rise by six feet by the end of this century, and the pace could pick up drastically in the 22nd century.
948 In a study last year, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University used their computer model to predict what would happen if emissions were reduced sharply over the next few decades, in line with international climate goals.
949 Under the most ambitious scenarios, they found a strong likelihood that Antarctica would remain fairly stable.”
952 The Alaskan tundra is warming so quickly it has become a net emitter of carbon dioxide ahead of schedule, a new study finds
954 Melting permafrost can release not just CO2, but also methane, a much stronger heat-trapping gas.
956 Data from NOAA’s Barrow Alaska station ‘indicate that October through December emissions of CO2 from surrounding tundra increased by 73 percent since 1975, supporting the view that rising temperatures have made Arctic ecosystems a net source of CO2.’”
957 ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C
960 This means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for 19 years
962 In April the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April 13 years ago
967 He said: ‘We have had five warming cycles since about 900AD, each followed by a dramatic cooling cycle.’
971 Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated.
972 “Arctic land stores about twice as much carbon as the atmosphere.
976 The gas builds up in the soil, forming mounds called ‘pingoes.’
978 The extreme cycles of dry and wet weather appear to have been intensifying over the last three decades.
979 “Warm weather worsened the most recent five-year drought, which included the driest four-year period on record in terms of statewide precipitation.
982 Not everyone is convinced that the evidence is in that climate change is responsible for extreme swings between drought and deluge.
983 ‘The dry periods are drier and the wet periods are wetter,’ said Jeffrey Mount, a water expert and senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.
988 The unlikely scenarios are now, all of a sudden, becoming more probable than they once were thought to be,’ says Sweet.”
990 many of south Florida’s drainage systems and seawalls are no longer enough
991 “Sea level rise is global.
993 While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually.”
994 says Sweet, who has authored several sea-level rise studies.
995 “The Northern Hemisphere jet stream […] flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large.
996 But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does […] the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated.
997 Ever since 2012, scientists have been debating a complex and frankly explosive idea about how a warming planet will alter our weather — one that, if it’s correct, would have profound implications across the Northern Hemisphere and especially in its middle latitudes
1001 ‘This study goes beyond statistical correlations and explores a specific process that can plausibly explain how enhanced high-latitude warming trends may trigger remote weather impacts,’ he said.
1003 A recent study in Nature Geoscience, for instance, called into question whether the Arctic’s melting, and in particular its sea ice loss, has been causing winter cooling over Eurasia, another idea that has been swept up in the debate over the jet stream and weather extremes.”
1007 ‘With levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consistently breaking new records, the influence of human activities on the climate system has become more and more evident,’ said Taalas.
1009 ‘Arctic ice conditions have been tracking at record low conditions since October, persisting for six consecutive months’
1010 “‘The Arctic may be remote, but changes that occur there directly affect us.
1011 The melting of the Greenland ice sheet is already contributing significantly to sea level rise, and new research is highlighting that the melting of Arctic sea ice can alter weather conditions across Europe, Asia and North America.’”
1013 Global sea level rise surged between November 2014 and February 2016, with the El Niño event helping the oceans rise by 15mm.
1014 Final data for 2016 sea level rise have yet to be published.
1017 Our children and grandchildren will look back on the climate deniers and ask how they could have sacrificed the planet for the sake of cheap fossil fuel energy, when the cost of inaction exceeds the cost of a transition to a low-carbon economy,’ Watson said.
1019 An additional kick was supplied by an El Niño weather pattern that peaked in 2016 and temporarily warmed much of the surface of the planet, causing the hottest year in a historical record dating to 1880.
1020 “The global reef crisis does not necessarily mean extinction for coral species.
1021 The corals may save themselves, as many other creatures are attempting to do, by moving toward the poles as the Earth warms, establishing new reefs in cooler water.”
1022 If water temperatures stay moderate, the damaged sections of the Great Barrier Reef may be covered with corals again in as few as 10 or 15 years
1023 Within a decade, certain kinds of branching and plate coral could be extinct, reef scientists say, along with a variety of small fish that rely on them for protection from predators.
1024 “CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases.
1028 A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.”
1034 Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 —
1038 (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.)”
1040 While evidence that the earth’s orbital variations impact radiation levels and thus global temperatures does not of course mean that man is not in some way impacting the climate, studies like these highlight that the role man plays on the planet is dwarfed by natural phenomena utterly out of our control.
1048 While transient weather variability is playing a key role here, the widespread record warmth across the U.S. so far this year is part of a long-term trend toward more warm temperature records versus cold ones.
1049 So far this month, there have been nearly 5,000 daily record highs set or tied, compared to just 42 daily record lows.
1050 In Albany, New York, the high temperature of 74 degrees on Thursday was the warmest temperature on record for any day during the months of December, January and February.
1052 But as that upper layer warms up, the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily.
1055 They do not make a definitive attribution statement, but the data are consistent with and strongly suggestive of human-driven warming as a root cause of the oxygen decline.’”
1056 Because oxygen in the global ocean is not evenly distributed, the 2 percent overall decline means there is a much larger decline in some areas of the ocean than others.
1057 “Moreover, the ocean already contains so-called oxygen minimum zones, generally found in the middle depths.
1061 warmer oceans have also begun to destabilize glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica
1065 However, this is exactly what climate scientists have predicted for California since at least the 1980s: protracted periods of warm, dry conditions punctuated by intense wet spells, with more rain and less snow, causing both drought and floods.
1066 […] in fact this pattern is already emerging, with the conditions that create extremely warm dry years and extremely wet years both becoming more frequent.
1067 “In an old climate, … extremely warm years were less common and snowpack was more reliable …
1069 “There is now less sea ice on Earth than at any time on record.
1073 The amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic has steadily declined over the past few decades because of man-made global warming, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
1075 “At the bottom of the world, sea ice is also at all-time record low levels around Antarctica, the data center said.
1077 Antarctic ice fluctuates wildly year to year, and the link to man-made global warming there is not clear, NASA ice expert Walt Meier said.
1078 “[Sea ice] also helps regulate the planet’s temperature by influencing the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean.
1079 “ NASA concurred with NOAA, also declaring 2016 the warmest year on record in its own data set that tracks the temperatures at the surface of the planet’s land and oceans, and expressing ‘greater than 95 percent certainty’ in that conclusion.
1082 “But the differences between NOAA and NASA aren’t that significant, Schmidt further argued, in the context of the bigger picture.
1083 ‘Getting hung up on the exact nature of the records is interesting, and there’s lots of technical work that can be done there, but the main take-home response there is that the trends we’ve been seeing since the 1970s are continuing and have not paused in any way,’ he said.”
1084 [Jonathan Overpeck:] ‘No doubt about it anymore — humans, mainly by burning fossil fuels, are cooking the planet,’ Overpeck said.
1087 The particular signature of warming in 2016 was also revealing in another way, Overpeck said, noting that the stratosphere… saw record cold temperatures last year
1088 ‘We don’t expect record years every year, but the ongoing long-term warming trend is clear.’”
1089 Last year’s warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef experienced its worst coral bleaching event on record and large scale coral death, to the Arctic, where sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were also the warmest on record, at least from January through September 2016.
1090 Extreme high temperatures were seen from India — where the city of Phalodi recorded temperatures of 51 degrees Celsius (123.8 Fahrenheit) in May, a new national record — to Iran, where a temperature of 53 degrees Celsius (127.4 F) was recorded in Delhoran on July 22.
1092 But then, just over a year ago, Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information[…] his results were surprising: there has been no reduction in oceanic pH
1093 Ocean acidification is the terrifying threat whereby all that man-made CO2 we’ve been pumping into the atmosphere may react with the sea to form a sort of giant acid bath.
1097 “[…]The impact on calcification, metabolism, growth, fertility and survival of calcifying marine species when pH is lowered up to 0.3 units […] is beneficial, not damaging.
1098 Marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification.”
1103 [ocean acidification was ] First referenced in a peer-reviewed study in Nature in 2003
1108 There was, he said, an ‘inherent bias’ in scientific journals which predisposed them to publish ‘doom and gloom stories’.
1109 “The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt.
1112 “The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker.
1113 This means the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes.”
1115 This “blocking” effect means extreme events can unfold.”
1116 Severe ‘snowmageddon’ winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked.
1119 Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: ‘The consensus points towards that being a real effect.’”
1120 The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link.
1121 Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.
1127 This means it is possible that by some yardsticks, 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter – because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year.
1130 The record warm years of 2015 and 2016 were primarily caused by the super El Nino.’”
1133 Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record.
1135 Scientists confirm a mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef this year has killed more corals than ever before, with more than two thirds destroyed across large swathes of the biodiverse site.
1136 When water temperatures become too high, coral becomes stressed and expels the algae, which leave the coral a bleached white color.
1138 Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off.
1139 Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up.
1141 “While record low sea ice is nothing new in the Arctic, this is a surprising turn of events for the Antarctic.
1142 Even as sea ice in the Arctic has seen a rapid and consistent decline over the past decade, its counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere has seen its extent increasing.”
1143 Skeptics have long pointed to ice gain in the Southern Hemisphere as evidence climate change wasn’t occurring, but scientists warned that it was caused by natural variations and circulations in the atmosphere.
1144 It “certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica’s ice is just going up and up,” Meier said.
1145 For what appears to be the first time since scientists began keeping track, sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic are at record lows this time of year.
1146 “It’s far too early to tell if what we are seeing in the Arctic, and now the Antarctic, is a sharp shift towards warmer poles with less ice.
1149 Temperatures in the Arctic have soared recently, and scientists are struggling to explain exactly why.
1150 To make matters worse, the water temperatures in the Arctic Ocean are several degrees above average, which is an expected result of having less sea ice.
1151 “Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas.
1154 [CO2] is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature.
1155 But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)
1156 The costs of emissions regulations, which will be paid by everyone, will be punishingly high and will provide no benefits to most people anywhere in the world.
1157 “In 2013 the level of U.S. farm output was about 2.7 times its 1948 level, and productivity was growing at an average annual rate of 1.52%.
1160 With more CO2 in the atmosphere, the challenge [feeding 2.5 billion more people] can and will be met.
1163 “Global warming and climate change, even if it is 100% caused by humans, is so slow that it cannot be observed by anyone in their lifetime.
1164 Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and other natural disasters have yet to show any obvious long-term change.”
1166 Drought in the western U.S. pales in comparison to the mega-droughts tree rings tell us existed in centuries past.
1167 Lake-bottom sediments in Florida tell us that recent major hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been less frequent than in centuries past.
1169 “Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years.
1170 If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade?”
1171 If Hillary would have fact-checked her example of sea level rise in Norfolk, Virginia, she would have found out that the experts already know this is mostly due to the land there sinking.
1173 […]until we develop a practical, cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels, it is unlikely that renewable energy will ever make up more than 15-20% of global energy requirements.
1175 But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening.
1178 “The most famous of these studies, published in 2010 by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji, showed that of 27 Pacific islands, 14% lost area.
1180 “It seems self-evident that rising sea levels will reduce land area.
1181 However, there is a process of accretion, where coral broken up by the waves washes up on these low-lying islands as sand, counteracting the reduction in land mass.
1183 “suggest that residents are fleeing atolls swiftly sinking into the sea.
1186 President Hilda Heine has told reporters that longtime residents are leaving the Marshall Islands because climate change is threatening the nation’s existence.”
1188 Policy makers who want to help the residents of the Marshall Islands today should look at improving the islands’ resilience
1198 ” ‘You see, gas in America is incredibly cheap, because of fracking,’ he says.
1202 The discrepancy between model-predicted warming and (lower) real-world observations has inspired new respect for natural climate variability relative to greenhouse-gas forcing.
1204 Back in the late 1980s, the UN claimed that if global warming were not checked by 2000, rising sea levels would wash entire counties away.
1205 “In 2009, then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown predicted that the world had only 50 days to save the planet from global warming.
1211 “climate economists see a positive externality, not a negative one, from the human influence on climate.
1212 (In technical lingo, the so-called social cost of carbon would be negative.)”
1216 …obsessing about climate change is avoiding a frank discussion about the here-and-now problems of budget deficits, the federal debt, school choice, entitlement reform, and so on.
1219 Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea.”
1222 The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities.
1223 Ice cap is disappearing far more rapidly than previously estimated, and is part of a long-term trend, new research shows
1224 “Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called ‘sunny-day flooding’ — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years.
1227 These tidal floods are often just a foot or two deep, but they can stop traffic, swamp basements, damage cars, kill lawns and forests, and poison wells with salt.
1230 On the Pacific Coast, a climate pattern that had pushed billions of gallons of water toward Asia is now ending, so that in coming decades the sea is likely to rise quickly off states like Oregon and California.
1235 “During ice ages, caused by wobbles in the Earth’s orbit, sea levels dropped more than 400 feet as ice piled up on land.
1237 the last sea-level high point, … occurred between the last two ice ages, about 125,000 years ago.
1239 Through decades of research, it has become clear that human civilization, roughly 6,000 years old, developed during an unusually stable period for global sea levels.
1240 “Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free
1243 by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free.
1245 There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer
1246 Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic’s summer sea-ice cover.
1247 People tend to think of an ice-free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change.
1251 “Underneath the permafrost there are sediments full of methane hydrates.
1253 “The most recent prediction of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that seas will rise by 60 to 90 centimetres this century.
1255 the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink.
1256 ‘Next year or the year after, the Arctic will be free of ice’
1257 “as surface temperatures of the oceans warm up, the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere.
1259 While the north-east, midwest and upper great plains have experienced a 30% increase in heavy rainfall episodes – considered once-in-every-five year downpours – parts of the west, particularly California, have been parched by drought.
1260 The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions.
1265 Some, however, bristle at the belief that because floods and storms have always occurred, they should not be linked to climate change”
1266 This means that the world is now 1C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times
1268 The thermal expansion of the oceans, compounded by melting glaciers, resulted in the highest global sea level on record in 2015.
1269 “The oceans, which absorb more than 90% of the extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere“
1270 The world’s alpine glaciers recorded a net annual loss of ice for the 36th consecutive year and the Greenland ice sheet … experienced melting over more than 50% of its surface.
1271 Greenland ice sheet … would balloon sea levels by around 7m should it disintegrate
1273 The rapid changes in the climate may have profound consequences for humans and other species… Severe drought caused food shortages for millions of people in Ethiopia, with a lack of rainfall resulting in “intense and widespread” forest fires in Indonesia that belched out a vast quantity of greenhouse gas
1276 “Typically, in such an attribution study, scientists will use sets of climate models — one set including the factors that drive human global warming and the other including purely “natural” factors — and see if an event like the one in question is more likely to occur in the first set of models.
1279 “Earlier this month, NASA scientists provided a visualization of a startling climate change trend — the Earth is getting greener, as viewed from space, especially in its rapidly warming northern regions.
1284 It is clear, then, that greening is emerging as a factor with the potential to blunt some of the worst impacts of human greenhouse gas emissions.
1286 Arctic greening was recently cited, in a major report by the U.S. Geological Survey, as the central reason that the state of Alaska, despite worsening wildfires and more thaw of permafrost, might still be able to stow away more carbon than it loses over the course of the 21st century.”
1292 Any reasonable person can recognize both positives and negatives among the policy proposals of both Tories and Labour.
1293 Over time, climate becomes a net problem: by the 2070s, the UN Climate Panel finds that global warming will likely cause damage equivalent to 0.2 per cent to 2 per cent of global GDP.
1294 “Because CO₂ acts as a fertilizer, as much as half of all vegetated land is persistently greener today.
1296 precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener
1299 A recent Nature study expecting more severe hurricanes from global warming still found that damages would halve from 0.04 per cent to 0.02 per cent of global GDP, because the increased ferocity would be more than made up by increased prosperity and resilience.
1300 “Yet, a new study of 60 climate models and scenarios shows this warning fails to take into account the fact that global warming will mean precipitation increases.
1303 No one ever says it, but in many ways global warming will be a good thing
1304 in a letter to The Times from Lord Krebs and company, essentially telling the newspaper to stop reporting less-than-negative climate stories.
1305 The projection that much of the Great Barrier Reef could perish within the next few decades could turn out to be too pessimistic, since other research has shown that some species of corals are surprisingly resilient to the stress from changing ocean temperatures.
1307 a new study by scientists at the Australian Research Council finds that the ongoing bleaching event is mainly due to human-caused global warming, and that if global warming proceeds as currently expected, “large parts” of the Great Barrier Reef could die by the mid-2030s.
1308 Great Barrier Reef may perish by 2030s
1310 It has occurred during the warmest year on record, which occurred in 2015, and the two most unusually mild months on Earth, which took place in January and February, respectively.”
1312 A World Heritage site, it is currently under assault from unusually hot ocean temperatures,”
1313 Coral bleaching has devastated 93% of the Great Barrier Reef
1314 Higher temperatures, we’re told, will be deadly—killing “thousands to tens of thousands” of Americans
1315 cold kills many more people than heat.
1316 In pushing too hard for the case that global warming is universally bad for everything, the administration’s report undermines the reasonable case for climate action.
1317 “…climate change will also reduce the number of cold days and cold spells.
1322 The report confidently claims that when temperatures rise, “the reduction in premature deaths from cold are expected to be smaller than the increase in deaths from heat in the United States.
1324 cold deaths actually occur during moderate temperatures
1325 “The Lancet researchers found that about 0.5%—half a percent—of all deaths are associated with heat, not only from acute problems like heat stroke, but also increased mortality from cardiac events and dehydration.
1326 But more than 7% of deaths are related to cold—counting hypothermia, as well as increased blood pressure and risk of heart attack that results when the body restricts blood flow in response to frigid temperatures.”
1327 Migration patterns show people heading for warm states like Texas and Florida, not snowy Minnesota and Michigan.”
1331 More than half of the 44 studies selected for publication found that raised levels of CO2 had little or no impact on marine life, including crabs, limpets, sea urchins and sponges
1333 “The oceans will never become acid because there is such a huge buffering capacity in the oceans.
1334 We simply could never release enough CO2 into the atmosphere to cause the pH to go below 7 [the point in the pH scale at which a solution becomes acidic].”
1339 “Dr Browman, a marine scientist for 35 years, said he was not saying that ocean acidification posed no threat, but that he believed that “a higher level of academic scepticism” should be applied to the topic.
1342 The worsening of tidal flooding in American coastal communities is largely a consequence of greenhouse gases from human activity, and the problem will grow far worse in coming decades, scientists reported Monday.
1343 roughly three-quarters of the tidal flood days now occurring in towns along the East Coast would not be happening in the absence of the rise in the sea level caused by human emissions.
1347 Scientists say the recent climate agreement negotiated in Paris is not remotely ambitious enough to forestall a significant melting of Greenland and Antarctica, though if fully implemented, it may slow the pace somewhat.”
1350 Until last June, most scientists acknowledged that warming reached a peak in the late 1990s
1351 a marginally significant warming trend in the data over the past several years, erasing the temperature plateau that vexed climate alarmists have found difficult to explain.
1353 Temperatures in 1999 were nearly three-tenths of a degree lower than in 1998, and a similar change should occur this time around, though it might not fit so neatly into a calendar year.
1354 Often the compensatory cooling, known as La Niña, is larger than the El Niño warming.”
1357 “The notion that world-wide weather is becoming more extreme is just that: a notion, or a testable hypothesis.
1360 In fact, the trend, while not statistically significant, is downward.”
1362 Forget what global warming activists would lead you to believe—2015 was not even close to the hottest year on record.
1365 Satellite temperature readings going back to 1979 show 1998 was by far the warmest year in the satellite era
1367 But we do have other reliable indicators of temperatures before the late 1800s, and the evidence shows temperatures have been warmer than today for most of the past several thousand years, including warmer-than-present temperatures for most of the human civilization time period
1369 “With a record El Niño, we should have experienced record high temperatures.
1372 The strong El Niño has continued into 2016, raising the possibility that this year will, yet again, set a global temperature record
1374 world temperatures, because they have gone up only very slowly, less than half as fast as the scientific consensus predicted in 1990
1375 the world is barely half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than it was about 35 years ago
1376 Also, it is increasingly clear that the planet was significantly warmer than today several times during the past 10,000 years.
1377 there has been no increase in frequency or intensity of storms, floods or droughts, while deaths attributed to such natural disasters have never been fewer
1378 Antarctica is gaining land-based ice, according to a new study by NASA scientists published in the Journal of Glaciology
1381 It projects that temperatures are likely to be anything from 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer by the latter part of the century
1383 a new study by a leading climate economist, Richard Tol of the University of Sussex, concludes that warming may well bring gains, because carbon dioxide causes crops and wild ecosystems to grow greener and more drought-resistant.
1384 A key study published in the Journal of Climate this year by Bjorn Stevens of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, found that the cooling impact of sulfate emissions has held back global warming less than thought till now
1386 “Global warming alarmists’ preferred electricity source – wind power – kills nearly 1 million bats every year (to say nothing of the more than 500,000 birds killed every year) in the United States alone.
1387 […] Killing 30 million bats every year in response to dubious claims that global warming might once in a great while kill 100,000 bats makes no sense.”
1389 If global warming caused the 2014 Queensland heat wave, why wasn’t it as severe as the 1972 Queensland heat wave?”
1390 “Lyme Disease is much more common in northern, cooler regions of the United States than in southern, warmer regions.
1394 U.S. Forest Service data show pine beetle infestations have recently declined dramatically throughout the western United States.
1395 Severe storms, floods and agricultural losses may cost a great deal of money, but such extreme weather events—and their resulting costs—are dramatically declining as the Earth modestly warms.
1397 alarmists here are taking overwhelmingly good news about global warming improving plant health and making it seem like this good news is actually bad news because healthier plants mean more pollen.
1399 Since the end of 2012, moreover, total polar ice extent has largely remained above the post-1979 average.
1400 The late 1970s marked the end of a 30-year cooling trend.
1401 As a result, the polar ice caps were quite likely more extensive than they had been since at least the 1920s.
1402 Beginning in 2005, however, polar ice modestly receded for several years.
1404 receding polar ice caps have little if any negative impact on human health and welfare, and likely a positive benefit
1406 Yet, according to NASA, only one temperature sensing station is necessary for the two cities and the vast area between them to be adequately represented in their network.”
1407 “In their award winning book, ‘Taken By Storm’ (2007), Canadian researchers Christopher Essex and Ross McKitrick explain: ‘Temperature is not an amount of something [like height or weight].
1410 “Temperature, like viscosity and density, and of course phone numbers, is not something that can be meaningfully averaged. ‘
1411 “Even if you could calculate some sort of meaningful global temperature statistic, the figure would be unimportant.
1414 The earth is 15 years from a “mini ice-age” that will cause bitterly cold winters during which rivers such as the Thames freeze over, scientists have predicted.
1416 In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon.
1420 Concentrated in the atmosphere, these gases do not allow the warmth of the sun’s rays reflected by the earth to be dispersed in space.
1421 The melting in the polar ice caps and in high altitude plains can lead to the dangerous release of methane gas
1425 Each year sees the disappearance of thousands of plant and animal species which we will never know, which our children will never see, because they have been lost for ever.
1426 Many of the world’s coral reefs are already barren or in a state of constant decline.
1430 Seventeen of the 18 warmest years have occurred since 2000.
1431 Eleven percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are caused by deforestation — comparable to the emissions from all of the cars and trucks on the planet.
1433 Eleven percent of the world’s population is currently vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, heat waves, extreme weather events and sea-level rise.
1434 Just 0.7% of the world’s forests are coastal mangroves, y​​​​​​et they store up to 10 times as much carbon per hectare as tropical forests.
1435 An area of coastal ecosystems larger than New York City is destroyed every year, removing an important buffer from extreme weather for coastal communities and releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
1441 195 countries signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, agreeing to limit global warming and adapt to climate change, partly by protecting nature.
1444 Natural climate solutions like ending deforestation and restoring degraded forests could, at the global level, create 80 million jobs, bring 1 billion people out of poverty and add US$ 2.3 trillion in productive growth.
1445 CO2 emissions from all commercial operations in 2018 totaled 918 million metric tons—2.4% of global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use.
1447 Flights departing airports in the United States and its territories emitted about one-quarter (24%) of global passenger transport-related CO2, two-thirds of which came from domestic flights.
1448 The top five countries for passenger aviation-related carbon emissions were rounded out by China, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany.
1449 43% of CO2 from commercial aviation was linked to passenger movement in narrowbody aircraft, followed by widebody jets (33%), and regional aircraft (5%).
1451 The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.
1452 Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with the five warmest years on record taking place since 2010.
1453 Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year — from January through September, with the exception of June — were the warmest on record for those respective months.
1454 The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969.
1455 The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass.
1458 Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.
1460 Global sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century.
1462 Both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades.
1463 The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950.
1464 The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events.
1465 Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent.13,14
1466 This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans.
1467 The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year.
1468 The bushfires in Australia were caused by arsonists and a series of lightning strikes, not 'climate change'.
1469 Discovery Of Massive Volcanic CO2 Emissions Discredits Global Warming Theory.
1473 A series of just-released studies by working-level scientists prove that geological and not atmospheric forces are responsible for melting of Earth’s polar ice sheets.
1474 Etna has already put more than 10,000 times the CO2 into the atmosphere than mankind has in our entire time on the Earth.
1475 More than 500 scientists and professionals in climate and related fields have sent a 'European Climate Declaration' to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
1476 The consensus among scientists and policy-makers is that we’ll pass this point of no return if the global mean temperature rises by more than two degrees Celsius.
1477 Human-produced carbon might be one of the factors of climate change, but there’s simply no evidence that it is a significant one.
1479 In no way, shape, or form are humans warming or cooling the planet.
1480 I think about all the 194 countries that signed onto the Paris accord, the U.S. is the one that's leading the world in reducing emissions.
1481 Based on the increase of solar activity during the twentieth century, it should account for between half to two-thirds of all climate change.
1482 18 proxies tell us the world was the same or warmer 1,000 years ago.
1484 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is misleading humanity about climate change and sea levels, and that in fact a new solar-driven cooling period is not far off.
1485 The human contribution to global warming was about 0.01°C.
1486 So that means that probably about half, maybe half of that nine-tenths of the degree of total warming might be caused by greenhouse gases.
1487 NASA has been adjusting temperatures from the past[...]
1488 New Study Confirms EVs Considerably Worse For Climate Than Diesel Cars.
1490 the concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere has climbed to a level last seen more than 3 million years ago — before humans even appeared on the rocky ball we call home.
1492 Sea level rise due to climate change is not going to happen.
1495 The models predicted about three times the amount of warming in the world we’ve seen since 1988.
1498 carbon dioxide has had a minuscule effect on global climate.
1499 Sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2.
1502 unadjusted data suggests that temperatures in Australia have only increased by 0.3 degrees over the past century, not the 1 degree usually claimed.
1503 climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming ‘hiatus’.
1504 Climate scientists say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse.
1505 according, again, to the official figures—during this past 10 years, if anything, mean global temperature, average world temperature, has slightly declined.
1506 Most likely the primary control knob on climate change is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.
1507 Global warming' is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.
1508 global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed (since 1997) by 19 years of stable temperature.
1510 Doubling the concentration of atmospheric CO2 from its pre-industrial level, in the absence of other forcings and feedbacks, would likely cause a warming of ~0.3°C to 1.1°C.
1512 more than 100 per cent of the warming over the past century is due to human actions.
1513 I would not agree that carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.
1515 no one really knows if last year 2016 was a global temperature record.
1516 the U.S. is shattering high temperature records far more frequently than it is shattering low temperature records.
1517 Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.
1519 The Earth’s climate is changing in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and particulate matter in the atmosphere, largely as the result of human activities.
1523 Research has found a human influence on the climate of the past several decades ...
