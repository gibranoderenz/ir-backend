2181 Humans survived past climate changes
2184 We have had ice ages and warmer periods when alligators were found in Spitzbergen.
2187 Scientific analysis of past climates shows that greenhouse gasses, principally CO2, have controlled most ancient climate changes.
2189 This makes it clear that this time around humans are the cause, mainly by our CO2 emissions.
2192 The data suggests solar activity is influencing the global climate causing the world to get warmer."
2193 In the last 35 years of global warming, the sun has shown a slight cooling trend.
2199 The consequences of climate change become increasingly bad after each additional degree of warming, with the consequences of 2°C being quite damaging and the consequences of 4°C being potentially catastrophic.
2200 The Petition Project features over 31,000 scientists signing the petition stating "There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide will, in the forseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere ...".
2201 That humans are causing global warming is the position of the Academies of Science from 80 countries plus many scientific organizations that study climate science.
2202 More specifically, around 95% of active climate researchers actively publishing climate papers endorse the consensus position.
2204 All the indicators show that global warming is still happening.
2205 "In fact global warming has stopped and a cooling is beginning.
2206 No climate model has predicted a cooling of the Earth – quite the  contrary.
2208 Empirical measurements of the Earth's heat content show the planet is still accumulating heat and global warming is still happening.
2209 Surface temperatures can show short-term cooling when heat is exchanged between the atmosphere and the ocean, which has a much greater heat capacity than the air.
2210 "[Models] are full of fudge factors that are fitted to the existing climate, so the models more or less agree with the observed data.
2212 While there are uncertainties with climate models, they successfully reproduce the past and have made predictions that have been subsequently confirmed by observations.
2213 The warming trend is the same in rural and urban areas, measured by thermometers and satellites, and by natural thermometers.
2214 "We found [U.S. weather] stations located next to  the exhaust fans of air conditioning units, surrounded by asphalt  parking lots and roads, on blistering-hot rooftops, and near sidewalks  and buildings that absorb and radiate heat.
2215 We found 68 stations located  at wastewater treatment plants, where the process of waste digestion  causes temperatures to be higher than in surrounding areas.
2217 Numerous studies into the effect of urban heat island effect and microsite influences find they have negligible effect on long-term trends, particularly when averaged over large regions.
2219 The increase in temperatures since 1975 is a consistent feature of all reconstructions.
2221 Natural temperature measurements also confirm the general accuracy of the instrumental temperature record.
2222 A large number of ancient mass extinction events have been strongly linked to global climate change.
2223 Because current climate change is so rapid, the way species typically adapt (eg - migration) is, in most cases, simply not be possible.
2227 Every part of the Earth's climate system has continued warming since 1998, with 2015 shattering temperature records.
2229 but Antarctica is losing land ice at an accelerating rate, which has implications for sea level rise.
2230 [Ice] is expanding in much of Antarctica, contrary to the widespread public belief that global warming is melting the continental ice cap.
2236 The majority of peer reviewed research at the time predicted warming due to increasing CO2.
2238 "An article in Science magazine illustrated that a rise in carbon dioxide did not precede a rise in temperatures, but actually lagged behind temperature rises by 200 to 1000 years.
2241 When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit.
2242 The warming causes the oceans to release CO2.
2243 The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet.
2244 So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2 rise.
2245 Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.
2246 "His [Dr Spencer's] latest research demonstrates that – in the short term, at any rate –  the temperature feedbacks that the IPCC imagines will greatly amplify  any initial warming caused by CO2 are net-negative, attenuating the  warming they are supposed to enhance.
2247 His best estimate is that the  warming in response to a doubling of CO2 concentration, which may happen  this century unless the usual suspects get away with shutting down the  economies of the West, will be a harmless 1 Fahrenheit degree, not the 6  F predicted by the IPCC."
2248 Climate sensitivity can be calculated empirically by comparing past temperature change to natural forcings at the time.
2250 Some global warming 'skeptics' argue that the Earth's climate sensitivity is so low that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 will result in a surface temperature change on the order of 1°C or less, and that therefore global warming is nothing to worry about.
2255 And  since the last ice age ended almost exactly 11,500 years ago…" (Ice Age Now)
2256 The warming effect from more CO2 greatly outstrips the influence from changes in the Earth's orbit or solar activity, even if solar levels were to drop to Maunder Minimum levels.
2257 'Our harmless emissions of trifling quantities of carbon dioxide cannot possibly acidify the oceans.
2260 The current debate on the connection between CO2 emissions and climate change has largely overlooked an independent and equally serious problem, the increasing acidity of our oceans.
2261 Last December, the respected  journal “Oceanography” published projections (see graphic below) for this rising acidity, measured by falling pH
2262 Since the hockey stick paper in 1998, there have been a number of proxy studies analysing a variety of different sources including corals, stalagmites, tree rings, boreholes and ice cores.
2263 They all confirm the original hockey stick conclusion: the 20th century is the warmest in the last 1000 years and that warming was most dramatic after 1920.
2266 A number of independent investigations from different countries, universities and government bodies have investigated the stolen emails and found no evidence of wrong doing.
2267 Focusing on a few suggestive emails, taken out of context, merely serves to distract from the wealth of empirical evidence for man-made global warming.
2268 “[T]he 1079 emails and 72 documents seem indeed evidence of a scandal  involving most of the most prominent scientists pushing the man-made  warming theory - a scandal that is one of the greatest in modern  science.
2272 It found the scientists' rigour and honesty are not in doubt, and their behaviour did not prejudice the IPCC's conclusions, though they did fail to display the proper degree of openness.
2275 […] Constant 24-7  media coverage of every significant storm worldwide just makes it seem  that way.”
2276 It is unclear whether global warming is increasing hurricane frequency but there is increasing evidence that warming increases hurricane intensity.
2277 Al Gore's film was "broadly accurate" according to an expert witness called when an attempt was made through the courts to prevent the film being shown in schools.
2280 While there are minor errors in An Inconvenient Truth, the main truths presented - evidence to show mankind is causing global warming and its various impacts is consistent with peer reviewed science.
2282 While there are isolated cases of growing glaciers, the overwhelming trend in glaciers worldwide is retreat.
2283 In fact, the global melt rate has been accelerating since the mid-1970s.
2284 Cosmic ray counts have increased over the past 50 years, so if they do influence global temperatures, they are having a cooling effect.
2286 By regulating the Earth’s cloud cover, the Sun  can turn the temperature up and down. ...
2288 While the link between cosmic rays and cloud cover is yet to be confirmed, more importantly, there has been no correlation between cosmic rays and global temperatures over the last 30 years of global warming.
2289 In fact, in recent years when cosmic rays should have been having their largest cooling effect on record, temperatures have been at their highest on record.
2290 Hypothetically, an increasing solar magnetic field could deflect galactic cosmic rays, which hypothetically seed low-level clouds, thus decreasing the Earth's reflectivity and causing global warming.
2293 Steve McIntyre noticed a strange  discontinuity in US temperature data, occurring around January 2000.
2295 As a result, "The warmest  year on US record is now 1934.
2298 (2012 is now the hottest by a wide margin), but the USA only comprises 2% of the globe.
2300 "Austria is today seeing its earliest snowfall in history with 30 to 40 centimetres already predicted in the mountains.
2302 Since the mid 1970s, global temperatures have been warming at around 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade.
2303 However, weather imposes its own dramatic ups and downs over the long term trend.
2304 We expect to see record cold temperatures even during global warming.
2305 Nevertheless over the last decade, daily record high temperatures occurred twice as often as record lows.
2308 "The 30 major droughts of the 20th century were likely natural in all respects; and, hence, they are "indicative of what could also happen in the future," as Narisma
2312 Everybody knows that the Pacific island of Tuvalu is sinking. ...
2313 Around 1990 it became obvious the local tide-gauge did not agree - there was no evidence of 'sinking.'
2317 What they find is sea level rise has been steadily accelerating over the past century.
2318 A paper by Ross McKitrick, an economics professor at the  University of Guelph, and Patrick Michaels, an environmental studies  professor at the University of Virginia, concludes that half of the  global warming trend from 1980 to 2002 is caused by Urban Heat Island.
2319 While urban areas are undoubtedly warmer than surrounding rural areas, this has had little to no impact on warming trends.
2320 While the Medieval Warm Period saw unusually warm temperatures in some regions, globally the planet was cooler than current conditions.
2323 Now scientists are telling us that Mars is experiencing its own planetary warming: Martian warming.
2325 Martian climate is primarily driven by dust and albedo and there is little empirical evidence that Mars is showing long term warming.
2326 "In 2007, the Northern Hemisphere reached a record low in ice coverage and the Northwest Passage was opened.
2328 What you were not told was that the data that triggered this record is only available back to the late 1970s.
2329 We know the Northwest Passage had been open before."
2330 Arctic sea ice has been retreating over the past 30 years.
2333 "While major green house gas  H2O substantially warms the Earth, minor green house gases such as CO2  have little effect....
2335 Satellite measurements of infrared spectra over the past 40 years observe less energy escaping to space at the wavelengths associated with CO2.
2336 Surface measurements find more downward infrared radiation warming the planet's surface.
2337 This provides a direct, empirical causal link between CO2 and global warming.
2338 The amount of warming caused by the anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 may be one of the most misunderstood subjects in climate science.
2344 Early estimates of ocean heat from the Argo showed a cooling bias due to pressure sensor issues.
2347 In truth, the overwhelming majority of climate-research funding comes from the federal government and left-wing foundations.
2358 The CO2 that nature emits (from the ocean and vegetation) is balanced by natural absorptions (again by the ocean and vegetation).
2359 Therefore human emissions upset the natural balance, rising CO2 to levels not seen in at least 800,000 years.
2360 In fact, human emit 26 gigatonnes of CO2 per year while CO2 in the atmosphere is rising by only 15 gigatonnes per year - much of human CO2 emissions is being absorbed by natural sinks.
2361 "Unquestionably, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was formed to build the scientific case for humanity being the primary cause of global warming.
2363 The IPCC lead authors are experts in their field, instructed to fairly represent the full range of the up-to-date, peer-reviewed literature.
2365 Comparisons to the most recent data consistently finds that climate change is occurring more rapidly and intensely than indicated by IPCC predictions.
2366 Increased CO2 makes more water vapor, a greenhouse gas which amplifies warming
2369 The public understand it, in that if  you get a fall evening or spring evening and the sky is clear the heat  will escape and the temperature will drop and you get frost.
2370 If there is  a cloud cover, the heat is trapped by water vapour as a greenhouse gas  and the temperature stays quite warm.
2374 Water vapour is the most dominant greenhouse gas.
2377 “A leading Canadian authority on polar bears, Mitch Taylor, said: ‘We’re  seeing an increase in bears that’s really unprecedented, and in places  where we’re seeing a decrease in the population
2378 The costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of mitigation.
2381 Economic assessments of proposed policy to put a price on carbon emissions are in widespread agreement that the net economic impact will be minor.
2384 Climate economics research shows that in reality, we are harming the economy by failing to implement CO2 limits.
2387 The Greenland ice sheet is at least 400,000 years old and warming was not global when Europeans settled in Greeland 1,000 years ago
2390 There may have been regions of Greenland that were 'greener' than today
2391 Greenland on the whole is losing ice, as confirmed by multiple satellite and on the ground field measurements.
2394 (2005), where satellite altimetry  established that the mean thickness of the entire Greenland ice sheet  had increased at 2 inches per year – a total of almost 2 feet – in the  11 years 1993-2003.”
2395 While the Greenland interior is in mass balance, the coastlines are losing ice.
2396 Overall Greenland is losing ice mass at an accelerating rate.
2398 While there are direct ways in which CO2 is a pollutant (acidification of the ocean), its primary impact is its greenhouse warming effect.
2399 While the greenhouse effect is a natural occurence, too much warming has severe negative impacts on agriculture, health and environment.
2400 'To suddenly label CO2 as a "pollutant" is a disservice to a gas that has played an enormous role in the development and sustainability of all life on this wonderful Earth.
2401 Mother Earth has clearly ruled that CO2 is not a pollutant.'
2402 Although it has some very important and beneficial effects, CO2 meets the legal and encyclopedic definitions of a "pollutant", and human CO2 emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare.
2406 This growth stimulation occurs because CO2 is one of the two raw materials (the other being water) that are required for photosynthesis.
2409 Less energy is escaping to space: Carbon dioxide (CO2) acts like a blanket; adding more CO2 makes the 'blanket' thicker, and humans are adding more CO2 all the time.
2410 "There is no actual evidence that carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming.
2411 Note that computer models are just concatenations of calculations you could do on a hand-held calculator, so they are theoretical and cannot be part of any evidence."
2413 Satellite and surface measurements find less energy is escaping to space at CO2 absorption wavelengths.
2414 Ocean and surface temperature measurements find the planet continues to accumulate heat.
2417 Mars, Triton, Pluto and Jupiter all show global warming, pointing to the Sun as the dominating influence in determining climate throughout the solar system."
2420 The sun has shown no long term trend since 1950 and in fact has shown a slight cooling trend in recent decades.
2422 As of today,JAXA shows that we have more ice than any time on this date for the past 8 years of Aqua satellite measurement for this AMSRE dataset."
2423 Arctic sea ice has been steadily thinning, even in the last few years while the surface ice (eg - sea ice extent) increased slightly.
2424 Consequently, the total amount of Arctic sea ice in 2008 and 2009 are the lowest on record.
2426 "Twentieth century global warming did not start until  1910.
2427 By that time CO2 emissions had already risen from the expanded use  of coal that had powered the industrial revolution, and emissions only  increased slowly from 3.5gigatonnes in 1910 to under 4gigatonnes by the  end of the Second World War.
2428 It was the post war  industrialization that caused the rapid rise in global CO2 emissions,  but by 1945 when this began, the Earth was already in a cooling phase  that started around 1942 and continued until 1975.
2429 With 32 years of  rapidly increasing global temperatures and only a minor increase in  global CO2 emissions, followed by 33 years of slowly cooling global  temperatures with rapid increases in global CO2 emissions, it was  deceitful for the IPCC to make any claim that CO2 emissions were  primarily responsible for observed 20th century global warming."
2430 Even during a period of long term warming, there are short periods of cooling due to climate variability.
2431 Short term cooling over the last few years is largely due to a strong La Nina phase in the Pacific Ocean and a prolonged solar minimum.
2432 The sun was warming up then, but the sun hasn’t been warming since 1970.
2434 The IPCC blames human emissions of carbon dioxide for the last  warming.
2438 Greenhouse gases have been the main contributor of warming since 1970.
2441 Furthermore, it is physically incorrect to state that the planet is simply "recovering" from the Little Ice Age.
2444 There are a number of forcings which affect climate (eg - stratospheric aerosols, solar variations).
2445 When all forcings are combined, they show good correlation to global temperature throughout the 20th century including the mid-century cooling period.
2447 The main reason behind this mid-century cooling was global dimming due to anthropogenic sulfate aerosol emissions.
2449 "January 2008 capped a 12 month period of global temperature drops on all of the major well respected indicators.
2453 "The killer proof that CO2 does not drive climate is to be found during the Ordovician- Silurian and the Jurassic-Cretaceous periods when CO2 levels were greater than 4000 ppmv (parts per million by volume) and about 2000 ppmv respectively.
2455 When CO2 levels were higher in the past, solar levels were also lower.
2457 "Of the rise in temperature during the 20th century, the bulk occurred from 1900 to 1940.
2460 That drop in temperature came after what was described in the National Geographic as 'six decades of abnormal warmth'."
2461 Early 20th century warming was in large part due to rising solar activity and relatively quiet volcanic activity.
2463 Volcanoes have been relatively frequent and if anything, have exerted a cooling effect.
2464 While natural forcings can account for much of the early 20th Century warming, humans played a role as well.
2468 "Satellite measurements indicate an absence of significant global warming since 1979, the very period that human carbon dioxide emissions have been increasing rapidly.
2474 Warming trends agree well with surface temperatures and model predictions except near the Poles.
2476 The global dimming trend reversed around 1990 - 15 years after the global warming trend began in the mid 1970's.
2478 (Kerr 2007) points out that the sunlight-reflecting haze that cools much of the planet seems to have thinned over the past decade or so.
2482 The warm and cool regions roughly balance each other out with little impact on global temperature.
2483 "Britain's big freeze is the start of a worldwide trend towards colder weather that seriously challenges global warming theories, eminent scientists claimed yesterday.
2484 The world has entered a 'cold mode' which is likely to bring a global dip in temperatures which will last for 20 to 30 years, they say.
2485 A natural cycle requires a forcing, and no known forcing exists that fits the fingerprints of observed warming - except anthropogenic greenhouse gases.
2486 The minute increase of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere (0.008%) was not the cause of the warming—it was a continuation of natural cycles that occurred over the past 500 years."
2487 The El Nino Southern Oscillation shows close correlation to global temperatures over the short term.
2488 However, it is unable to explain the long term warming trend over the past few decades.
2489 "Three Australasian researchers have shown that natural forces are the dominant influence on climate, in a study just published in the highly-regarded Journal of Geophysical Research.
2493 Mount Kilimanjaro's shrinking glacier is complicated and not due to just global warming.
2494 There is ample evidence that Earth's average temperature has increased in the past 100 years and the decline of mid- and high-latitude glaciers is a major piece of evidence.
2495 'Gore claims the snowcap atop Africa's Mt. Kilimanjaro is shrinking and that global warming is to blame.
2497 Without the forests' humidity, previously moisture-laden winds blew dry.
2499 First, they concur with the believers that the Earth has been warming since the end of a Little Ice Age around 1850.
2500 Believers think the warming is man-made, while the skeptics believe the warming is natural and contributions from man are minimal and certainly not potentially catastrophic à la Al Gore.'
2501 The human fingerprint in global warming is evident in multiple lines of empirical evidence - in satellite measurements of outgoing infrared radiation, in surface measurements of downward infrared radiation, in the cooling stratosphere and other metrics.
2502 Fundamental physics and global climate models both make testable predictions as to how the global climate should change in response to anthropogenic warming.
2506 The IPCC confirms that computer modeling predicts the existence of a tropical, mid-troposphere “hot spot” about 10km above the Earth’s surface.
2508 "The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a temperature pattern in the Pacific Ocean that spends roughly 20-30 years in the cool phase or the warm phase.
2509 In 1905, PDO switched to a warm phase.
2510 In 1946, PDO switched to a cool phase.
2511 In 1977, PDO switched to a warm phase.
2515 When the PDO last switched to a cool phase, global temperatures were about 0.4C cooler than currently.
2516 The long term warming trend indicates the total energy in the Earth's climate system is increasing due to an energy imbalance.
2520 According to the second law of  thermodynamics such a planetary machine can never exist."
2521 The atmosphere of the Earth is less able to absorb shortwave radiation from the Sun than thermal radiation coming from the surface.
2522 The effect of this disparity is that thermal radiation escaping to space comes mostly from the cold upper atmosphere, while the surface is maintained at a substantially warmer temperature.
2523 This is called the "atmospheric greenhouse effect", and without it the Earth's surface would be much colder.
2530 Glaciers are in rapid retreat worldwide, despite 1 error in 1 paragraph in a 3000 page IPCC report.
2531 "In 1999 New Scientist reported a comment by the leading Indian glaciologist Syed Hasnain, who said in an email interview with this author that all the glaciers in the central and eastern Himalayas could disappear by 2035.
2536 But the central message of the IPCC AR4, is confirmed by the peer reviewed literature.
2538 Satellites and on-site measurements are observing that Himalayan glaciers are disappearing at an accelerating rate.
2539 "[T]he influence of  so-called greenhouse gases on near-surface temperature - is not yet  absolutely proven.
2540 In other words, there is as yet no incontrovertible  proof either of the greenhouse effect, or its connection with alleged  global warming.
2542 The statement that so-called greenhouse gases,  especially CO2, contribute to near-surface atmospheric warming is in  glaring contradiction to well-known physical laws relating to gas and  vapour, as well as to general caloric theory.'
2547 The modelers confused cause and effect, thereby getting the feedback in the wrong direction."
2549 "Many people think the science of climate change is settled.
2552 The geologic record provides us with abundant evidence for such perpetual natural climate variability, from icecaps reaching almost to the equator to none at all, even at the poles.
2553 The climate debate is, in reality, about a 1.6 watts per square metre or 0.5 per cent discrepancy in the poorly known planetary energy balance."
2555 Different areas of science are understood with varying degrees of certainty.
2556 For example, we have a lower understanding of the effect of aerosols while we have a high understanding of the warming effect of carbon dioxide.
2557 Poorly understood aspects of climate change do not change the fact that a great deal of climate science is well understood.
2560 In the 11,400 years since the end of the last Ice Age, sea  level has risen at an average of 4 feet/century, though it is now rising  much more slowly because very nearly all of the land-based ice that is  at low enough latitudes and altitudes to melt has long since gone."
2561 Observed sea levels are actually tracking at the upper range of the IPCC projections.
2562 When accelerating ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica are factored into sea level projections, the estimated sea level rise by 2100 is between 75cm to 2 metres.
2564 This small warming is  likely a result of the natural alterations in global ocean currents  which are driven by ocean salinity variations.
2565 Human kind has little or nothing to do with the recent temperature changes.
2568 "The IPCC also made false predictions on the Amazon rain forests, referenced to a non peer-reviewed paper produced by an advocacy group working with the WWF.
2570 The IPCC statement on Amazon rain forests is correct.
2571 The error was incorrect citation, failing to mention the peer-reviewed papers where the data came from.
2574 On a world scale coral reefs are in decline.
2575 Over the last 30-40 years 80% of coral in the Caribbean have been destroyed and 50% in Indonesia and the Pacific.
2577 "Three recent articles give us reason to question the alarmists’ claims  that coral reefs are in deep trouble due to the buildup of greenhouse  gases." (World Climate Report)
2579 Over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere.
2580 Volcanoes emit around 0.3 billion tonnes of CO2 per year.
2583 "Each unit of CO2 you put into the atmosphere has less and less of a warming impact.
2584 Once the atmosphere reaches a saturation point, additional input of CO2 will not really have any major impact.
2587 If the CO2 effect was saturated, adding more CO2 should add no additional greenhouse effect.
2588 However, satellite and surface measurements observe an enhanced greenhouse effect at the wavelengths that CO2 absorb energy.
2590 This argument originates from Angstrom's work in 1901.
2591 We now know that the planetary energy balance is determined by the upper levels of the troposphere and that the saturation of the absorption at the central frequency does not preclude the possibility to absorb more energy.
2592 "A July 6, 2007 study published in the journal Science about Greenland by an international team of scientists found DNA “evidence that suggests the frozen shield covering the immense island survived the Earth’s last period of global warming,” according to a Boston Globe Article.  ...
2593 [T]he study indicates “Greenland’s ice may be less susceptible to the massive meltdown predicted by computer models of climate change, the main author ... said in an interview. ...
2599 Small amounts of very active substances can cause large effects.
2600 "We have been grossly misled to think there is tens of thousands of times as much CO2 as there is!
2602 If the public were aware that man-made CO2 is so incredibly small there would be very little belief in a climate disaster ..."
2603 While methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, there is over 200 times more CO2 in the atmosphere.
2605 "A United Nations report has identified the world's  rapidly growing herds of cattle as the greatest threat to the climate,  forests and wildlife. ...
2606 ...Livestock are responsible for 18 per cent of the  greenhouse gases that cause global warming, more than cars, planes and  all other forms of transport put together.
2607 Burning fuel to produce fertiliser to grow feed, to  produce meat and to transport it - and clearing vegetation for grazing -  produces 9 per cent of all emissions of carbon dioxide, the most common  greenhouse gas.
2608 And their wind and manure emit more than one third of  emissions of another, methane, which warms the world 20 times faster  than carbon dioxide.
2609 Individual carbon dioxide molecules have a short life time of around 5 years in the atmosphere.
2611 The final amount of extra CO2 that remains in the atmosphere stays there on a time scale of centuries.
2612 [T]he overwhelming majority of peer-reviewed studies  [find] that CO2 in the atmosphere remained there a short time.
2613 CO2 levels are measured by hundreds of stations scattered across 66 countries which all report the same rising trend.
2614 "The Keeling curve, which is widely used to show the increase in CO2 emissions, is based on data from the top of Mount Mauna Loa in Hawaii.
2616 To claim that humidity is decreasing requires you ignore a multitude of independent reanalyses that all show increasing humidity.
2618 It fails to explain how we can have short-term positive feedback and long-term negative feedback.
2620 "...the largest of all the positive or temperature-amplifying feedbacks in  the UN’s arsenal is the water-vapor feedback.
2623 (2009) have demonstrated recently  – the upper troposphere (the only place where adding CO2 to the  atmosphere could make any difference to temperature) is considerably  drier than the models are tuned to expect."
2627 Neptune's orbit is 164 years so observations (1950 to present day) span less than a third of a Neptunian year.
2630 "A new storm and a new red spot on Jupiter hints at climate change, USA TODAY and dozens of other sources explained yesterday.
2631 The temperatures are expected to change by as much as 10 Fahrenheit degrees at different places of the globe.
2632 At least close to the new spot and to the equator, nothing less than global warming is expected"
2633 Jupiter's climate change is due to shifts in internal turbulence fueled from an internal heat source - the planet radiates twice as much energy as it receives from the sun.
2641 In a paper published online this week in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmosphere, economics professor Ross McKitrick says the resulting discrepancies may be leading to an overstatement of the role of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
2643 The "decline" refers to a decline in northern tree-rings, not global temperature, and is openly discussed in papers and the IPCC reports.
2649 "Mike's Nature trick" has nothing to do with "hide the decline", instead refering to a technique by Michael Mann to plot instrumental temperature along with past reconstructions.
2650 The decline in tree-ring growth is openly discussed in papers and IPCC reports.
2656 The divergence of tree-ring proxies from temperatures after 1960 is openly discussed in the peer-reviewed literature and the last two IPCC assessment reports.
2657 Currently, humans are emitting around 29 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per year.
2661 Current CO2 levels are the highest in 15 million years.
2662 "...there is the contention by Wolfgang Knorr of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol in England that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are about where they were 160 years ago." (as quoted by Ken Ward Jr.)
2664 Warming causes more moisture in the air which leads to more extreme precipitation events.
2666 Far from contradicting global warming, record snowfall is predicted by climate models and consistent with our expectation of more extreme precipitation events.
2668 Meanwhile, it will likely to continue to snow in Chicago in the coming days.
2671 There have long been claims that some unspecificed "they" has "changed the name from 'global warming' to 'climate change'".
2673 They changed the name from “global warming” to “climate change” after the term global warming just wasn’t working (it was too cold)!
2678 Measurements of carbon isotopes and falling oxygen in the atmosphere show that rising carbon dioxide is due to the burning of fossil fuels and cannot be coming from the ocean.
2679 "The solubility of carbon dioxide in water is listed in the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics as a declining function of temperature. ...
2682 The IPCC’s predicted equilibrium warming path bears no relation to the far lesser rate of “global warming” that has been observed in the 21st century to date.
2687 It seems scientists have noticed recently that quite a few planets in our solar system seem to be heating up a bit, including Pluto."
2688 Pluto's climate change over the last 14 years is likely a seasonal event.
2689 Pluto experiences drastic season changes due to an elliptical orbit (that takes 250 Earth years).
2691 There are a myriad of other radiative forcings that affect the planet's energy imbalance.
2692 Volcanoes, solar variations, clouds, methane, aerosols - these all change the way energy enters and/or leaves our climate.
2693 While there are many drivers of climate, CO2 is the most dominant radiative forcing and is increasing faster than any other forcing.
2694 The Independent Climate Change Email Review investigated the CRU scientists' actions relating to peer review.
2698 The Review concluded that CRU's actions were normal and did not threaten the integrity of peer review.
2702 While it's true that any single country's CO2 emissions reductions will make little difference, only if every nation agrees to limit CO2 emissions can we achieve significant cuts on a global scale.
2704 Australia accounts for 1.5 per cent of global carbon emissions.
2706 Monckton appears to have cherry-picked temperature data from a few stations.
2707 The full data for latitudes 64-90°N reveal the Arctic is warmer today than in 1940.
2709 When you account for the effects which are not reflected in the market price of fossil fuels, like air pollution and health impacts, the true cost of coal and other fossil fuels is higher than the cost of most renewable energy technologies.
2710 [Wind energy] is a more expensive way of producing energy than the alternative.
2711 'Antarctic sea ice set a new record in October 2007, as photographs distributed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed penguins and other cold-weather creatures able to stand farther north on Southern Hemisphere sea ice than has ever been recorded.
2712 The news of expanding Antarctic sea ice stole headlines from global warming alarmists who asserted Arctic sea ice had reached its lowest extent since 1979.'
2720 The result did suggest the sea level  was increasing in the western Pacific, but this was offset by a drop in  the level near the Alaskan coast.
2721 “Our analyses do not indicate  acceleration in sea level in U.S. tide gauge records during the 20th  century,” the study’s authors concluded.
2726 Humans are emitting 26 gigatonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere.
2729 89 percent of the stations fail to meet the National Weather Service’s own siting requirements that stations must be 30 metres away from an artificial heating or radiating/reflecting heat source.
2733 A number of independent studies using near-global satellite data find positive feedback and high climate sensitivity.
2735 It appears, for the entire tropics, the observed outgoing radiation fluxes increase with the increase in sea surface temperatures (SSTs).
2736 The observed behavior of radiation fluxes implies negative feedback processes associated with relatively low climate sensitivity.
2738 When you read Phil Jones' actual words, you see he's saying there is a warming trend
2741 'Phil Jones said that for the past 15 years there has been no "statistically significant" warming.
2743 "a [cloudcover] change in the Tropics could lead to a negative feedback in the global climate, with a feedback factor of about –1.1, which if correct, would more than cancel all the positive feedbacks in the more sensitive current climate models" (Lindzen et al.
2744 Dropped stations show more warming than kept stations.
2745 Two American researchers allege that U.S. government scientists have  skewed global temperature trends by ignoring readings from thousands of  local weather stations around the world, particularly those in colder  altitudes and more northerly latitudes, such as Canada.
2746 Dropped weather stations actually show a slightly warmer trend compared to kept stations.
2750 There is no way for us to prevent the world’s CO2 emissions    from doubling by 2100"
2751 The argument that solving the global warming problem by reducing human greenhouse gas emissions is "too hard" generally stems from the belief that (i) our technology is not sufficiently advanced to achieve significant emissions reductions,
2753 However, studies have determined that current technology is sufficient to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the necessary amount, and that we can do so without significant impact on the economy.
2754 "There are many urgent priorities that need the attention of Congress, and it is not for me as an invited guest in your country to say what they are.
2755 Global warming is an increasingly urgent problem.
2762 One more decade of business as usual will make this impossible.
